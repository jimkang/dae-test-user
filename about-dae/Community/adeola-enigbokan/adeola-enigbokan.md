Adeola Enigbokan is an environmental psychologist. Using creative public engagement, she re-imagines the relationships between citizens, consumers, institutions and corporations, and the environments they inhabit. She combines deep knowledge of human behavior and emotional intelligence, with a sense of how social and spatial systems work and how creative change happens. She consults on the design of urban housing, workspaces, urban public space and emerging technologies. She has taught Urban Sociology at the University of Amsterdam and New York University, Architectural Design at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy. She holds a PhD in Psychology from the City University of New York, and a BA in Anthropology from Columbia University.
