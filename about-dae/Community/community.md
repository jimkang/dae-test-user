# COMMUNITY

## About the Design Academy Eindhoven Community

At Design Academy Eindhoven, students, tutors, heads and staff learn with and from each other. As well as producing some of the world's leading designers, over the years the school has invited an enviable list of leading creative minds and industry figures from around the world to teach and collaborate with students. Many have become long-term supporters and allies of the school, creating the foundation for a network that has helped cement DAE's reputation worldwide.

Today, our dedicated and knowledgable community of designer-teachers, alumni, industry and research experts and advisors is complemented by the Friends of DAE, who support the school in many different ways. Together, they ensure that the school continues to provide the best help, expertise and knowledge to its students and give both current students and graduates access to a unique and unparalleled professional network.

Through the DAE community, students can find relevant and exciting internships and work placements, access specialised workplaces and makers for help and advice with their projects, and collaborate with industry on research and real-world projects, giving them opportunities to apply and practice their design skills beyond the walls of the institution.

This extensive network also enables DAE to be agile and respond to major changes and emerging issues within the design industry and the wider world faster than the average institution.

The DAE community is an invaluable part of the school. To thank all of the individuals involved for their continuing support, the Academy has developed an annual relationship program. This includes, among other things, special privileges for community members, design lectures, guided tours and a programme of morning meetings.

To show our appreciation and to thank everybody DAEâ€™s community for their continuing support the academy has developed a yearly relationship program with among others dedicated privileges for its relations, design lectures, special morning meetings, and guided tours. Feel free to contact us if you would like to be part of our network and read what DAE and its community can offer you in return.
