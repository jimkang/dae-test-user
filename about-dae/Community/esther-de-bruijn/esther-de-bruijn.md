At DAE Esther fulfills the post of XR Officer: a title that is still rather unknown - she does practical research in all kinds of interactive fields, a.o. in VR, AR, and comparable settings â€“ all this to support the Research department practically and conceptually.

Esther has an enormous interest for new technologies, especially in the art world, and continuously updates herself or taking on new projects that are on the limits of her skillset - just so she can expand them. She believes that technologies should be a natural augmentation of our bodies and minds. After graduating at the KABK in the Hague she has been expanding her knowledge by starting up Studio Vodka, where she creates 3D art, VR experiences, and light installations.
