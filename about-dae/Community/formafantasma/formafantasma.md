Andrea Trimarchi and Simone Farresin are the founders of Studio Formafantasma, based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and Heads of the Geoâ€“Design MA at Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE). 

Both originally from Italy, Trimarchi and Farresin graduated from the Contextual Design MA at DAE in 2009. Together, they have developed an approach to design that is characterised by experimental material investigations and a rigorous attention to context, process and detail. 

Widely published, collected and exhibited internationally, their work interrogates the role of design in contemporary society. Exploring the historical, political and social forces that have shaped our environments, they have engaged in projects that focus on issues such as the relationship between tradition and local culture, the ecological responsibilities of design and the significance of objects as cultural conduits. 

Perceiving their practice as a bridge between craft, industry, object and user, they are interested in forging links between their research-based practice and the wider design industry.
