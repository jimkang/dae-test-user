Irene Droogleever Fortuyn

Irene is a visual artist and studio leader of Studio Urgencies at Design Academy Eindhoven.

Fortuyn established herself as an artist in the early 1980s as one half of Fortuyn/O'Brien. She had her first solo show at the Stedelijk Museum and participated in Documenta IX in the early 1990s when urban space began to play an increasingly important role in her work as a source of inspiration, a field of research and as a space for social and sculptural installations.

She created the Amsterdam-based Ketter&Co Foundation, which aims to develop and shape a sustainable society by asking questions, making connections and creating cross-disciplinary projects that foster change.

Fortuyn has held management positions in various cultural organisations and is currently chairman of the supervisory board of the European Ceramic Work Centre (EKWC). She was appointed head of the former Leisure department at DAE in 2000 and named Studio Leader of Studio Urgencies in 2020 under the school's new pedagogical model.
