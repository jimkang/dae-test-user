Jelle Zijlstra is an industrial designer, educator and studio leader of Studio Turn Around! at Design Academy Eindhoven.

Based in Rotterdam, Zijlstra works as a product designer for clients including Gazelle Bicycles, Union Bicycles and the Dutch Postal and Telecom Services. In 1995, he developed the Fietshangar, a safe storage unit for five bicycles that fits into half a parking spot, which has been widely adopted across Europe. He also develops exhibitions, urban mobility solutions and the implementation of sustainable design methods.

Zijlstra studied Industrial Design Engineering at TU Delft, where he later began his teaching career. In 2013, he co-edited the Delft Design Guide, a collection of design methods taught at the university (second revised edition issued in 2020).

In 2012, he was appointed head of Man and Mobility at DAE, which he reshaped to create Studio Motion. In 2020, he founded Studio Turn Around! as part of an overhaul of the school's pedagogical model, with a focus on ecological and societal issues in relation to developments in technology.
