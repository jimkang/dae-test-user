"Designers who work with the subject ‘food’ are often called food designers. According to Marije Vogelzang, food is already perfectly and beautifully designed by nature. She designs from the verb to eat. She is for example inspired by the origin of food, the etiquette, politics, history or the culture of food. That is why she doesn’t call herself food designer but, as the first in the world, eatingdesigner. It is often thought that designers who work with food only design the shape of the food that is on your plate. Vogelzang wonders if there even is a plate. Her aim is to look at the content and background of the food. The shape is just a tool to tell the story. Vogelzang is trying to show the exploration and potential of a new approach on the act of eating (or is it a new approach on design?).  

Having graduated at the Design Academy in Eindhoven in 2000, Marije set her mind on creating a new direction in the field of design. After having developed and sold two experimental restaurants called ‘PROEF’ in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, she broadened her experiments and developed her vision to design out of the verb of eating. She works solo again under her own name. After 20 years of experience she is considered a pioneer and the ‘Grand dame’ in the field of eating design (De Volkskrant). Vogelzang works on restaurant concepts as well as long-term medical projects for hospitals. She initiates social projects like workshops to educate and inspire but she also does some extensive work for food industries. She designs art installations and curates exhibitions about eating and design. She is the studio leader of Studio Living Matter at Design Academy Eindhoven, started in 2014. Her work has been published and acknowledged globally and Marije is a successful speaker on conferences worldwide.  

In 2015, Marije is part of Fast Company’s top 100 most creative people in business and a finalist of the World Technology awards in the Design section. In 2016 She is on the GOOD100 list of Good Magazine.  

In 2016 Marije initiated the Dutch institute of Food and Design. A global network to celebrate the connection between food and design. The DIFD is behind the Future Food Design Awards and produces a traveling exhibition about the future of food (starting in Canada in 2019) [www.thedifd.com](https://www.thedifd.com)
