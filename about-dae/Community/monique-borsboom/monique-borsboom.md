As a young little girl Monique was fascinated by the idea that everything around us is designed. Endless ideas, exploring and creating was the base and motivation to study at the Design Academy. After graduating in 2004 she started working as a designer and team leader for the international brands Maxi-Cosi and Quinny. Designing products that are sold all over the world, where innovation and smart solutions made the difference. Over the years her specialty became softgoods and textile design. Many well-known and award-winning products are part of her portfolio.

Besides her work for big brands, she always combined her commercial work with other small-scale projects, like her own baby product line and co-creating photography projects.

In 2016 she came back to DAE as coordinator. Her experience as a design professional and her social skills make her fit the job. But most of all she loves the vibe of this unique school, these inspiring colleagues and energetic students.
