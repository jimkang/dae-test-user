Stijn Roodnat is a Dutch Designer and studio leader of Studio Collaborative Solutions at Design Academy Eindhoven.

His interests tend towards structure and manufacturing techniques, and clear designs that belie the complicated processes that make them possible.

Roodnat graduated from Design Academy Eindhoven in 1999 and quickly gained attention with his final project, the Suitchair, a chair made from fabric and filled with foam to make it solid. Together with his partner and fellow Marleen Kaptein, he created the Amsterdam-based design studio KapteinRoodnat. The studio has undertaken a wide range of projects, including interiors, architecture, furniture, applications, products, installations and artworks. In 2007, the studio was nominated for the Rotterdam Design Prize. KapteinRoodnat’s list of clients including the Martinez Gallery in New York, Mandarina Duck in Paris and Hotel Arena in Amsterdam and the studio’s work has been exhibited in galleries around the world and featured in numerous publications.

Roodnat is also the director of the design brand Label/Breed, which he co-founded in 2016 to bring together designers and manufacturers, realising innovative and sustainable objects through unique collaborations.
