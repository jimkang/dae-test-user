# EDUCATION ORGANISATION & PLANNING EMPLOYEE

Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE) is a leading educational institute in the field of Design. The various departments within the four-year higher vocational Bachelor programme and the two- year Master programme train students from different perspectives to produce critical and socially engaged designers.

DAE sees design as a global phenomenon with an increasing urgency to reform social structures and systems. These include reforms in the fields of consumption, care, social organisation and future industries, but the list is inexhaustible.

The fact that many nationalities and cultures meet here, enriches our work area and contributes to the validity of the projects in a worldwide context. In addition to being a higher vocational education institute, DAE functions as an institute where there is room for debate. This interaction forms an important building block for both our curricula and our research agenda, and enables DAE to educate people who are capable of making meaningful contributions to social developments around the world.
