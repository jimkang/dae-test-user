Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE) is an internationally leading educational institute in the field of Design. The various departments within the four-year higher vocational Bachelor programme and the two-year Master programme train students from different perspectives to produce critical and socially engaged designers. Besides the educational programmes, DAE has international research lectorates focussed on collaborative, interdisciplinary projects.
