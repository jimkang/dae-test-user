# WEB DEVELOPER
(project based)

Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE) is one of the world’s leading design schools, recognised internationally for its forward-thinking and renowned professors and alumni. For over 70 years it has trained aspiring designers to make their mark on the future by thinking freely and openly about what design can achieve, consistently exploring design as an instrument of material, social, environmental and critical innovation. Today it is home to a community of many nationalities and cultures, offering an environment where personal perspectives on the world can be translated into meaningful and daring propositions. They are guided in this by a team of professional designers, architects, researchers, writers and curators, all active within the academy as well as in the professional field.

DAE is a University of the Arts, offering both BA and MA degrees, specialised in training students in different design perspectives in order to produce critical and socially engaged designers. In conjunction with the educational programmes, DAE has international Readerships focused on collaborative research projects. The commonality at DAE is the shared political values of an inclusive society that embraces diversity in every aspect. In addition, the hybrid, conceptual, contextual and international approach to design makes DAE’s programmes distinctive.
