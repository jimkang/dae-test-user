# XR OFFICER AT DAE RESEARCH LAB
(24 hours a week, starting of 1st September)

Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE) is a leading educational institute in the field of Design. The various departments within the four-year higher vocational Bachelor programme and the two- year Master programme train students from different perspectives to produce critical and socially engaged designers. Besides the educational programmes, DAE has international research lectorates focussed on collaborative, interdisciplinary projects. DAE sees design as a global phenomenon with an increasing urgency to reform social structures and systems. These include reforms in the fields of consumption, care, social organisation and future industries, but the list is inexhaustible. According to DAE, designers are responsible for exploring and finding alternatives.

In addition to being a higher vocational education institute, DAE functions as an institute where there is room for debate. This interaction forms an important building block for both our curricula and our research agenda, and enables DAE to educate people who are capable of making meaningful contributions to social developments around the world.

DAE is home to about 700 students and 250 staff members with a great diversity of nationalities. The fact that many nationalities and cultures meet here enriches our work area and contributes to the validity of the projects in a worldwide context. As we build our excellence on the diversity of our staff and student community, we pay continual attention to diversity and inclusion and provide a safe learning and working environment in a broader sense. We foster equality and inclusion, and promote respect and a sense of belonging for all. We therefore encourage applications from all sections of society.

# ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT
In a constantly changing world, research is fundamental to meaningful design and design education. New technologies form the base of our understanding of the present role of the designed world and the role of the designer. By learning from the past and the world around us, we can make informed decisions and contribute to shaping a future that we want to live in. Without this, we would create blindly, wasting both time and resources in an era where both are becoming increasingly rare and valuable commodities. In the school, this is manifested in using research through design – an approach that sees each design projects as a research- led moments of enquiry.
Being a University of the Arts that specialises in Design, DAE is also a productive environment for debates, lectures and the production of discourse. This aspect of reflection is an important building block for both our curricula and our research agenda and enables DAE to train people who are able to make meaningful contributions to social developments worldwide.

Within DAE, three international professors with a focus on networks, education and diversity form a newly established research lab. The Lab is using applied design research, new visualization technology and social research and discourse to create projects in the field of educational design. This will be acheived by creating new ways of learning and interaction in games engines such as unreal or unity, including technolgies such as AR, VR and MR. Your task will be to closely collaborate with the professorial team in applying these technologies.

# ABOUT THE FUNCTION
Our Research department is looking for a XR Officer. New research initiatives at Design Academy Eindhoven are investigating the application of advanced digital systems and XR visualization technologies in collaborative design and education. In order to accomplish this we are looking for a XR Officer to support two of our professors. The two professors, dr. Ian Biscoe with a background in systems engineering, architecture and arts practice, and dr. Annika Frye as an experienced design researcher and theorist, are working on complimentary research themes that both adopt a contemporary analogue/digital hybrid approach.
