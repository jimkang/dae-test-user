# XR SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS ASSISTANT
(24 hours a week) for immediate employment

Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE) is a leading global educational institute in the field of Design. The various departments within the four-year higher vocational Bachelor programme and the two-year Master programme train students from different perspectives to produce critical and socially engaged designers. Besides the educational programmes, DAE has international professorships focussed on collaborative, interdisciplinary projects.

DAE sees design as a global phenomenon with an increasing urgency to reform social structures and systems, including the fields of consumption, care, social organisation and future industries, but the list is inexhaustible. According to DAE, designers are responsible for exploring and finding alternatives.

DAE is home to about 700 students with a great diversity of nationalities. The fact that many nationalities and cultures meet here enriches our work area and contributes to the validity of the projects in a worldwide context. This does not release us from the necessity of paying continual attention to diversity, inclusion and providing a safe learning and working environment in a broader sense.
In addition to being a higher vocational education institute, DAE functions as an institute where there is room for debate. This interaction forms an important building block for both our curricula and our research agenda, and enables DAE to educate people who are capable of making meaningful contributions to social developments around the world.

# ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT
Our Research department is looking for a XR Software and Systems Assistant. New research initiatives at Design Academy Eindhoven are investigating the application of advanced digital systems and XR visualization technologies in collaborative design and education. In order to accomplish this we are looking for a XR Software and Systems Assistant to support two of our research professors. The two researchers, Ian Biscoe with a background in systems engineering, architecture and arts practice, and Annika Frye an experienced design researcher and theorist, are working on complimentary research themes that both adopt a contemporary analogue/digital hybrid approach.
 
# WHAT WILL YOU BE DOING?
The research programmes are addressing new forms of education and design environments that employ technologies such as XR / AR / VR, games engines, machine learning, network and mobile devices. You will be working with emerging technologies and have practical and demonstrable experience with the majority of the following:

 - Unity and/or Unreal games engines and development environments;
 - Competent programming skills in one or more of: C#, C++, Python, Blueprint;
 - Development of AR applications on Android and/or iOS platforms, using ARCore and/or Xcode/ARKit, Java and/or Swift;
