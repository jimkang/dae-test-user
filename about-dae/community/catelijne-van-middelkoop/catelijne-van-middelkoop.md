Prof. Catelijne van Middelkoop is a third generation Dutch designer, studio leader of Studio Moonshots at Design Academy Eindhoven, a Full Professor of Visual Communication Design at TU Delft’s Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering and advisor ‘Commercial Practices’ /lecturer ‘Data Design’ (theory) at the Willem de Kooning Academy (WdKA). Her main research interests include the influence of emerging technologies on the field of visual communication design, the changing role of the designer in a predominantly digital age dictated by machines, as well as speculative futures for art and design education. 

Catelijne started out studying Art History and Archeology at the University of Amsterdam in 1994 yet graduated from the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague with a Bachelor degree in Graphic and Typographic Design in 2000. The research and thesis project she worked on during graduate school at Cranbrook Academy of Art (MI, USA) focused on design tooling and digital crafts, topics she explores in even more depth and from both a human and non human perspective in an ongoing research project called “Unlearning humans and machines. Towards new forms of education in art and design.” 

Besides being involved in education and research, Catelijne is member of the advisory committee ‘Design’ at the Creative Industries Fund NL, and perhaps most importantly, one of two directors of Strange Attractors Design, a trans-disciplinary (research) studio co-founded with Ryan Pescatore Frisk in 2001 which uses new and traditional media to create innovative solutions and shape strategic questions to influence culture and commerce. 
 
“Whether it takes the form of typography, type designs, posters, catalogs, digital animations, CD covers, or 3-D installations, their work is a polemic against the depersonalizing effects of modernist typography and design. Such projects are often described for being superficial, but that criticism misses the point. In today's visual cultures, the surface very often is the message. Strange Attractors are “decorationalists’” (I borrow the term from Denise Gonzales Crisp), who want to rediscover the potential of expressive ornamenation. They use the computer not just as an extension of the ordening brain, as Marshall McLuhan would say, but also as a true instrument of the expressive hand.” (Max Bruinsma)
