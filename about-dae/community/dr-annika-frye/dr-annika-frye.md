Dr Annika Frye is a designer and researcher. Her practices include writing, teaching and projects in the field of experimental industrial design. Also a professor of Design Studies at Muthesius Academy of the Arts in Kiel, Germany, she is currently researching changes in design processes regarding the qualities of digital materiality in the intersection of design, art and technology. A summary of her recent work can be found at annikafrye.de.

Dr Frye is an expert in Open Design – which, in the context of design processes, breaks up hierarchies by creating a network of actors – and has recently been exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education. In the next stage of her research, she will investigate how to apply the strategies of Open Design to digital learning in design. Her Professorship responds to and anticipates the next stage of an extraordinarily fertile culture of fully or partly remote learning opportunities and online or blended education programmes that has emerged in the last decade. It aims to recognise learning as becoming, using technology as an instrument of evolution and democratisation of learning in design. 

What if design education was open, accessible and participatory? Overturning traditional concepts of the ‘design school’ and questions how design education is designed, Dr Frye will experiment with new practices of networking, communication and digital learning spaces to challenge the idea of the school as an enclosed, spatial entity. 

The project will research, visualise and test the possibilities of opening up ‘the school‘, to develop a technological solution (e.g. designing a platform) as well as social experiences. The research will interrogate the notion of space – specifically the ‘space’ of the school as digital space, with all the implications regarding bodily presence that this entails, as well as its impact on diversity and social experiences and networks. 

The notion of the system will also be key. Systems are of particular relevance in relation to today’s educational practices, just as they are for a wide range of issues and topics. The investigation of systems will be an important element across DAE’s Professorships and an area for cross-collaboration.
