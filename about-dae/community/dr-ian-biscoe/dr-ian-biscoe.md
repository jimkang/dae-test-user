Dr Ian Biscoe is a visual and performance artist, director, producer, entrepreneur, designer and engineer with degrees in architecture and landscape architecture. His research practice brings together the arts and technology, with a transdisciplinary approach that draws on his background in science, systems integration, technology, architecture, performing and visual arts, design and business.  His research around the fusion of art, science and technology, includes the study of cognitively enabled built environments, and X Reality networked performance – the subject of his PhD thesis.

Dr Biscoe’s recent projects are infused with theories of space and time, exploring themes of identity, freedom, truth, responsibility and connectivity. His work is typically produced in collaboration and realised in multidisciplinary formats. His projects employ a variety of movement, music, sound, painting, live video, photography, film and scenography; blending analogue and digital techniques. A summary of his recent projects, research and educational activities can be found at studiobiscoe.com.

Dr Biscoe also runs Digital Networked Arts (DNA), an initiative at the Fontys School of Arts in Tilburg, in which knowledge is shared on digital and network technologies for transdisciplinary collaborations in performing arts, education and design. 

At DAE, Dr Biscoe’s research will focus on technological and societal networks, investigating how macroscopic thinking can be leveraged to address the global system-of-system challenges we all face. He will build on existing original research in the use of X-Reality networked environments in art practice and education to investigate issues around planetary analysis, comprehension, design and communication.

A goal of the Professorship is the realisation of new tools through which creatives can work collaboratively to better comprehend and address the challenges that are the result of global systems dynamics – networked workspaces for creatives that enable collaboration regardless of location and that support rich visualisation across realities. The creation of such environments should support the transdisciplinary investigation and development of designed solutions to planetary challenges. These networked environments should also provide a greater understanding of the interaction of these complex systems through the communication of those complexities beyond domain experts.
