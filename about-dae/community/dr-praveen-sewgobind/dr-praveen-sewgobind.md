With an Indian, Surinamese and Dutch cultural background, Dr Praveen Sewgobind is an activist-academic researcher working to further diversity and ethnicity theory in the Netherlands. His PhD in Critical Cosmopolitanisms is geared towards understanding and developing theories and practices of cultural diversity. His dissertation revolves around the entanglements of memory, race, and coloniality in Suriname and the Netherlands. Through his work, he has created a global network of academics and activists. 

Dr Sewgobind is a part-time visiting postdoctoral researcher at the Amsterdam School for Cultural Analysis at the University of Amsterdam. His research on the constructs of racism in the Netherlands motivates him to sustain critical projects that enable the shifts necessary to materialise diversity and inclusion based on an empowering and emancipatory agenda. He sees his work to theorise racism as inextricably connected to addressing configurations of power and privilege, with examples including his contribution to the current ERIF (European Race & Imagery Foundation) campaign.

In his research at Design Academy Eindhoven, Praveen aims to contribute to dismantling exclusion by embracing structural diversity in the context of the city. Cities have traditionally been loci power and privilege, as well as sites where their unequal distribution has been contested and dismantled. 

The framework and drive for research in his Professorship at DAE focusses on theorising and materialising the conditions for inclusivity and diversity. Diversity and inclusivity are urgent topics that are too often used to make institutions look good, instead of being used as tools to truly enable a sense of belonging. This sense of belonging is fundamental for real inclusivity and diversity. Unless they are welcomed in a social context, those who have traditionally been marginalised will struggle to have a place at the table in the shifting dynamics of cities. His research catalyses instruments that underscore the necessity of ‘walking the walk’. 

The Professorship also aims to develop and implement pedagogical strategies that will feed into the Bachelor’s and Master’s programs at DAE. For example the tool of the ‘walkshop’ – a critical educational experience whereby participants become actors and engage with the real world. The ‘walkshop’ combines practical and theoretical tools and contributes to the idea of the city as a place for cross-pollination and learning rather than exclusion and superficiality.
