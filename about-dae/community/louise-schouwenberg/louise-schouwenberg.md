She combines an understanding of the hands-on artistic process with a philosophical research of art and design. Her main interest is the close relationship between people, things and contexts, and how they shape each other.

Schouwenberg has contributed to a wide variety of publications on art and design, including monographs on some of the world’s leading creatives in those fields. She has (co-) curated exhibitions for museums including Die Neue Sammlung / Pinakothek der Moderne in München, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam and the Textile Museum in Tilburg. Apart from teaching at DAE, she has lectured at various art and design schools worldwide, including Politecnico in Milan, the Gerrit Rietveld Academy and the Sandberg Instituut in Amsterdam, and Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Nürnberg.

Schouwenberg studied psychology at Radboud University, Nijmegen, sculpture at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy, Amsterdam, and philosophy at the University of Amsterdam.
