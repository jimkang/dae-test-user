Saskia van Gelder is both coordinator and teacher of Studio Identity at Design Academy Eindhoven.

After my education as a fashion designer at Gerrit Rietveld Academy Amsterdam, I discovered my love and admiration for fashion fabrics and my talents for textile design. 

Ever since, I have been working as ambulant designer, specialised in fashion fabric forecasting and product development; starting off my career as co-founder of an Amsterdam based design studio, I ended up working as freelancer for several design studios and fashion companies in Amsterdam, Paris and Barcelona.

During the last 30 years, forecasting and concepting for Japanese fabric manufacturers and editors have been my main focus. 

Acknowledging and trusting my intuition as driving force behind my creative work became my personal design credo. 
I never get enough of looking at people, intrigued and surprised by why and how they seek and find new means of expression through their appearance.

Almost simultaneously with starting my design practice, I have been teaching, eager and proud to share my experiences, knowledge and insights on forecasting and design with younger generations. I was engaged in the education of several fashion and textile courses in academies in Holland (Amsterdam, Arnhem, The Hague) and Finland (Helsinki).
