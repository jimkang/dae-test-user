Thomas Lommée is studio leader of The Morning Studio at Design Academy Eindhoven and founder of OpenStructures (OS), an ongoing exploration of durable and democratic forms of design. Openstructures is a construction model that links modularity to open collaboration and unfolds through a continuously evolving process by a community of authors that test and evaluate its potential within the fields of design, art and architecture.

Together with Christiane Högner, he is partner of Brussels-based OS_Studio, the creative studio and major driving force behind OpenStructures. Earlier he founded Intrastructures, a ‘pragmatic utopian design studio’, applying product-, service- and system design as tools for change.

Lommée studied at Design Academy Eindhoven and the Institute without Boundaries, Toronto. He has lectured and taught at design schools and institutions across Europe. He was previously a tutor in DAE's Social Design and Well-being departments and co-founded a studio on crowdfunding-based design at the ENSCI – École nationale supérieure de création industrielle – in Paris.
