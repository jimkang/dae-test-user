# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE: 4 November 2021

In the wake of the success of last month’s Graduation Show, Geo–Design: Budget Airlines at the Van Abbemuseum, and all of the Dutch Design Week activities where Design Academy Eindhoven graduates and alumni were able to share their work, we’ve been in a celebratory mood. 

But last Tuesday's announcement from the Dutch Government regarding Covid-19 was sobering. We must not forget that we are still in the midst of a pandemic – one that continues to have a serious impact on the health and lives of millions of people. The take-up of vaccinations in the Netherlands is still not high enough to protect the most vulnerable in our community, and after weeks of relaxed restrictions, cases are on the rise again. 

New rules
The government is tightening the rules again to help get this situation back under control. We are altering our own rules within the Academy to reflect the new measures.

From 6 November, anyone within the Academy building must:
– wear a mask while walking around and moving through the building and library
– wear a mask when using any of the workshops 

We urge you all to also follow the advice on maintaining social distancing and keeping at least 1.5-metres apart where possible, although this is not currently compulsory. The one-way walking routes through the Academy building remain in place and must be followed. Free self-testing kits are available from the DAE reception but don’t forget to stay at home if you have any symptoms, even if they are very mild, and call your doctor.

HR
The government has advised that staff should work at home for half of their hours. All employees should discuss this with their manager to find an appropriate solution. 

Outside DAE
From 6 November, many establishments serving food and drinks, cultural venues and public buildings will introduce a Covid-19 check, and wearing a mask will be mandatory again at more locations. You can find more information on this here: <https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2021/11/02/press-conference-2-november-2021>

The Covid-19 check involves showing valid proof that you are fully vaccinated, have already had Covid-19 or have recently had a negative test result. Those vaccinated in the Netherlands and the EU will be able to present their personal Covid-19 QR code on their phone and a valid form of ID. Those vaccinated abroad should consult the official guidelines published [online](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-covid-19/coronabewijs/vaccinatiebewijs/gevaccineerd-in-het-buitenland).

It is possible to register a non-EU vaccination within the Dutch system if:
- You are a Dutch national; or
- You live in the Netherlands; or
- you have been vaccinated in Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten.
You can also register your vaccination if you have had one shot outside the EU and one in the Netherlands. 

Call for an appointment in Utrecht or Groningen: 030 - 8002899. 
You will receive the address in the appointment confirmation. 

All students can be vaccinated for free (see [map](https://designacademyeindhoven.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/MediaforWebsite/EeQo7ZhY1tlOgLY4ed-lun4BdOVFtxi1ICGtNVdnX-bLSg?e=4eJbsV))
• you do not need to make an appointment upfront
• you must bring some form of ID (if you bring your BSN, the vaccination will be added to the Corona app, which acts as a vaccine passport, so this is the best option if possible)
• your first vaccination will be with Moderna or Pfizer. The Jansen vaccine is only available on special request
• if you have been given the first vaccination already, the attending doctor will help you decide on the best option for the second vaccination.

If you are struggling with the impact of Covid-19 in any way – or with any other issue – you can always talk to a mentor, student counsellor <https://designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/student-life/care> or one of our confidential counsellors <https://designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/student-life/confidential-counsellor>. They are all here to listen and to offer advice if you need it. 

We will continue to follow the guidelines and rules set by the Dutch government for higher education. If anything changes, we are ready to move towards a hybrid approach, blending online teaching and on-site practical work based on our experiences of the last two years. We’ll also adopt this system if a group within the school is asked to quarantine.

We hope to be in touch again soon with more positive news.

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE: 27 September 2021

It’s been a pleasure to see so many of you returning to the Academy building over the past few weeks and to see so many first-years arriving to begin their studies. In the wake of a successful Milan Design Week (congratulations to the exhibition team and graduates!), it almost feels like we are getting back to normal. But we must not become complacent. Covid-19 still lingers and it’s important we continue to follow the guidelines to ensure a save study and work environment and a similarly successful Dutch Design Week next month.

Last week, the Dutch government rolled back some of the Covid-19 measures that had previously been in place. Within educational institutions, the maximum group size of 75 students no longer applies. We also do not have to follow the 1.5-metre social distancing rule or wear masks while moving around.

However, we must respect the fact that some members of our community are more vulnerable than others and that the rolling back of these measures might make some people feel less safe. Many people will choose to continue to wear masks to help protect each other. It is not appropriate to ask anyone wearing a facemask to remove it for any reason while inside the Academy building.

When visiting the Academy building please:
– follow the basic hygiene and health measures and wash your hands regularly
– use the voluntary self-testing programme regularly. Tests are available for free via the Reception desk.
– be aware that the spaces you are using are well ventilated and check to open the windows if necessary
– continue to follow the walking routes established within the building and follow the one-way system on the staircases
– use the booking systems and schedules for the workshops and library and do not queue

We will continue to follow the guidelines and rules set by the Dutch government for higher education. If anything changes, we are ready to move towards a hybrid approach, blending online teaching and on-site practical work based on our experiences of the last two years. We’ll also adopt this system if a group within the school is asked to quarantine.

Working from home 
HR will be in touch with staff in the coming weeks to outline our plans for welcoming everyone back to work in the DAE building again! 
 
All students can be vaccinated for free [see enclosed map](https://designacademyeindhoven.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/MediaforWebsite/EYdYAAAdHzpNpgnJVLkMuDEB5ufD4hrk3xQrp6prYCsShQ?e=jgnhSw)
 - you do not need to make an appointment upfront
 - you must bring some form of ID (if you bring your BSN, the vaccination will be added to the Corona app, which acts as a vaccine passport, so this is the best option if possible)
 - your first vaccination will be with Moderna or Pfizer. The Jansen vaccine is only available on special request
 - if you have been given the first vaccination already, the attending doctor will help you decide on the best option for the second vaccination.

Make sure you are following the latest advice and regulations from the Dutch government. You can check these here: <https://www.government.nl>

For more information about the DAE regulations you can always check the Q&A on our new website, which will be updated this week.
 
Stay safe, and don’t hesitate to ask for support if you need it. 
Our counsellors are always available to talk.

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE: 30 August 2021

Welcome to all of our new 1st years! We’re greatly looking forward to meeting you all and reuniting with the community as we return to full on-site education from September. 

We will continue to follow the guidelines and rules set by the Dutch government for higher education. If anything changes, we are ready to move towards a hybrid approach, blending online teaching and on-site practical work based on our experiences of the last year-and-a-half. We’ll also adopt this system if a group within the school is requested to quarantine. 

The rules for using the building have changed slightly, and we have many new community members, so below is an outline of what you need to know when coming into the Academy. 

The main rules 
 - Wear a mask when moving around the Academy 
 - Stay home and get tested if you have any symptoms 
 - Follow the one-way system on the staircases 
 - Use the booking systems and schedules for the workshops and library

The Dutch government is removing the requirement to maintain 1.5-metre social distancing within educational institutions. However, for everyone’s safety, DAE requires everyone entering or walking around the Academy building to wear a facemask, including in workshops, teaching spaces and social spaces. Mask-wearing is compulsory while moving around, but wearing a mask while seated is a personal decision, except when you are in a workshop. 

Under no circumstances is it appropriate for tutors, staff or students to ask anyone within the community to remove a mask while in the building, even if it is hard to understand what someone is saying. 

Educational facilities must ensure that a maximum of 75 students, excluding teachers or supervisors, are present in each independent space where educational activities occur. Luckily, our educational spaces are well suited for this. 

Z-BAR 
Walking routes need to limit contact between students. For this reason, there is a traffic light system for entering the Z-Bar, which will remain in place. This system also helps ensure a maximum group size of 75. Everyone who wants to stay in the Z-Bar is expected to take a seat. This will also apply to upcoming events within DAE. 

Testing 
Covid-19 is not yet under control, so testing for infections remains an important strategy in keeping our community and those around us safe. 

At DAE, we encourage the use of rapid tests for the peace of mind of our own students, teachers and staff, but also as part of our commitment to the city of Eindhoven and its inhabitants. Anyone who has any of the known symptoms of the virus can request an official free test via the government’s [booking](https://coronatest.nl/) system.  

Students and staff are advised by the Dutch Government to self-test twice a week. Self-testing kits are available for free from the DAE reception on the 2nd floor for anyone who would like to use them. They are free for anyone in the DAE community, including students, freelancers, visiting tutors, staff and examiners. You can also order free tests via the website [www.zelftestonderwijs.nl](https://www.zelftestonderwijs.nl). Log in with your DAE account details by selecting Design Academy Eindhoven from the list of schools that appears when you click on the log-in button. The tests take a few days to arrive, so if you already have symptoms, please do not wait and schedule a test via [Coronatest.nl](http://coronatest.nl/) or call 0800 1202. 

Ventilation 
DAE has a ventilation system that brings fresh air into the building. Used air is blown out of the building via a separate channel. We do not have a recirculation system. 

In August 2020, we invited experts to measure our ventilation system and to advise us. The outcome of the research is that the installation blows sufficient fresh air into the building to meet the standards in the Buildings Decree in relation to how we occupy it. Keeping windows and doors open, preferably those opposite each other, will support our measures but is unnecessary, especially during wintertime. 
 
Working from home 
HR will be in touch with staff in the coming weeks to outline our plans for welcoming everyone back to work in the DAE building again! 

Travel and vaccinations 
If you are travelling to the Netherlands for the first time to join us at DAE or returning to resume your studies, please ensure you are fully aware of the [travel guidance](https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/visiting-the-netherlands-from-abroad) relating to your country of departure and leave plenty of time to follow any quarantine and testing requirements before you visit the Academy.  

All students can be vaccinated for free [see map here](https://designacademyeindhoven.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/MediaforWebsite/EYdYAAAdHzpNpgnJVLkMuDEB5ufD4hrk3xQrp6prYCsShQ?e=hn3a9A_

 - you do not need to make an appointment upfront 
 - you only need an ID, however: if you have your BSN first, that is better because then the vaccination will be added to the Corona app 
 - your first vaccination will be with Moderna or Pfizer, Jansen at special request 
 - if you had the first vaccination already, the present doctor will discuss with you what second vaccination will be best for you to take. 
 
Stay safe, and don’t hesitate to ask for support if you need it. Our [counsellors](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/student-life/care) are always available to talk.

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE: 23 June 2021

As the Netherlands and other countries begin to open up again, this should be the penultimate update from us about DAE’s Covid-19 regulations this academic year.  
 
Many of us are greatly looking forward to finally returning to full on-site education in September, and we are hopeful that this will be possible. We will share further news on this in a final update before the summer holidays. When we return, we expect to be able to focus on other things in our regular communications with you.  
 
Thank you to everyone for following the rules and helping us keep DAE open against the odds over the past few months. We will no longer need to use the check-in desk for students and visitors. You can enter the building freely.  
 
Self-testing kits for all of the DAE community, including students, freelancers, visiting tutors, staff and examiners, are now available for free from the reception for anyone who would like to use them. 
 
As this extraordinary year draws to an end, we particularly want to acknowledge the incredible grace and flexibility that our graduating students have demonstrated in response to the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic. 
 
The BA graduation ceremony will take place in the Witte Dame Zaal on Thursday and will be staggered to allow us to invite all of the graduates into the space. Like the MA ceremony, which took place last week, it will also be live-streamed so that friends and family can follow the event from anywhere in the world.  
 
→ New regulations from the Dutch Government 
 
The Dutch Government is due to update its regulations on 26 June, but we do not expect this to have any significant impact on our plans or rules for using the Academy building, which will remain in place until the summer.  
 
Although the government is removing the obligation to wear a facemask in many scenarios, within DAE we will still need everyone to wear a facemask in situations where staying 1.5-metres apart is impossible, including in workshops, education and events/hospitality. To keep things simple, anyone entering or walking around the Academy building will also still be required to wear a mask.  
 
From 26 June the government’s work-from-home recommendation is also changing. Staff can expect an update from HR regarding these new regulations soon, so please keep an eye on your inbox. 
 
In mid-August the government will decide how and when the final step of the reopening plan can be taken. This will involve lifting the 1.5-metre rule and the other basic rules. 
 
→ Summer workshop access 
 
The workshops will be closed to students from 12 July until 20 August. There will be limited access to the workshops in the weeks beginning 5 July and 22 August. Library opening hours can be found on the DAE website within the [Library section](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/research-and-debate/library). Our team needs a break. Thank you again to all of the workshop staff for their dedication and unwavering support for all of DAE’s students.  
 
In the following weeks, we will be able share some updates on what to expect for anyone returning to the Academy at the beginning of the new Academic year.  
 
In the meantime, please use your common sense, wash your hands and maintain mask-wearing and social distancing regulations within DAE if you need to use the building and make sure you are following the latest advice and regulations from the Dutch government. You can check this here: <https://www.government.nl> 
 
We hope that everyone can enjoy themselves this weekend despite the rain, and wish all of the students about to sit their re-do’s and endterms good luck!

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE: 10 May 2021
 
We know that you’re all busy with the end of the Academic year rapidly approaching, so we’ll keep this one brief! 
 
From this week, it is possible for all DAE student and staff to access free self-testing kits for Covid-19. 
 
This service is delivered via the website [www.zelftestonderwijs.nl](https://www.zelftestonderwijs.nl). You can log in with your DAE account details by selecting Design Academy Eindhoven from the list of schools that appears when you click on the log-in button. 
 
This website is only currently available in Dutch. Non-Dutch speakers can get around this by using a translation plug-in in their browsers or a free online translation site such as Deepl or Google Translate (we do not officially support any of these services, but they can be quite useful). 
 
The tests take a few days to arrive, so if you already have symptoms please do not wait and schedule a test via [Coronatest.nl](https://www.coronatest.nl) or call 0800 1202.
 
At the moment, the service is restricted to one order per person, so it is limited. But, hopefully, this will mean one less trip outdoors if you suspect you have symptoms at some point during your studies and more certainty for everyone. As always, please let your coordinator know if you are sick and need to stay at home, and alert them immediately if you receive a positive test result. 
 
Good luck to you all in the coming weeks. We hope to be in touch with more positive news again soon.

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE: 14 April 2021

It is refreshing to write to you all with some good news! Last night, the Dutch government announced plans for easing us out of the current lockdown and reopening the country.
 
The government’s step-by-step plan will only begin to be rolled out after the 28 April, and only if the number of serious Covid-19 cases has begun to fall. In other countries, we have seen this happen as their vaccine programme has progressed, so there is reason to be hopeful.
 
If all goes smoothly, we will be free of the curfew and be able to use terraces and shops again by the end of this month. All colleges and universities in the Netherlands will also be able to reopen.
 
Until the 28th, all the current measures remain in place. The idea that the curfew might be cancelled and terraces reopened sooner was abandoned due to the number of current infections and hospitalisations of patients with Covid-19. We urge you all to continue to respect the regulations and play your part in keeping each other safe, both inside and outside of the Academy building.
 
Opening hours
Before yesterday’s announcement, we had already started to plan to keep the Academy open for longer so that more of you can use the facilities. From 19 April, all of the workspaces will be open until 20:00.
 
We will return to normal opening hours on the first Monday following the announcement of the end of the curfew. If this happens as planned on the 28 April, then the entire Academy will resume normal hours on 3 May. If it is delayed, we will adjust accordingly.
 
Working from home
We want to say thank you again to our staff, tutors, heads, studio leaders and coordinators for their perseverance and flexibility. Working from home is not an ideal situation for everyone, especially in this scenario. Being stuck behind a screen and working in Teams for hours on end can be surprisingly draining. Please don’t forget to take regular screen breaks and talk to your team leader if you are struggling in any way.
 
If the Covid-19 measures are relaxed on 28 April as expected, then HR will share with you how we can welcome you all back to work in the DAE building again in the upcoming weeks!
 
You should also have received an email from HR about self testing. If you have any questions about this, please contact <susan.molle@designacademy.nl>.
 
Student self-testing kits
The Dutch government is launching a national testing policy for Higher Education institutions, with self-testing kits introduced to reduce the risk of transmission within schools. We intend to adopt this approach across DAE and will update all current students as soon as we know more.
 In the meantime, anyone who has any of the known symptoms should request a free test via the [government’s booking system](https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-test).
 
Corona coaches
Thank you also to everyone who cooperated with the security team we introduced a few weeks ago within the Academy building. We did this to ensure that social distancing and mask wearing rules were being followed, as this protects everyone using the building and also ensures we can keep it open. We’re happy to say that there has been a great improvement in how the rules are observed, and the collective awareness and respect for each other’s safety has changed for the better.
 
We hope to be in touch again soon with more good news, if and when the government begins lifting the restrictions. Please remember that we are not out of the woods yet. Stay safe and don’t hesitate to ask for support if you need it. Our [counsellors](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/student-life/care) are always available to talk.

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE: 17 Mar. 2021

Keeping the DAE building safe and open for everyone that wants to use it is one of our main concerns during this period. This will not be possible if the rules continue to be broken.
 
In our last update, we explained the DAE had been forced to introduce a temporary security team to monitor the Academy's spaces and ensure that the Covid-19 rules were being followed.
 
Frustratingly, it seems that this approach was not strong enough, and we must now increase the level of crowd control by quarantining areas within the building.
 
So, starting from today, we are introducing a system of warnings, which – if ignored – culminate in the temporary suspension of access to spaces within the Academy for everyone in this particular area. This system will be annoying for everyone, but it seems that it is necessary for the time being.
 
We hope this will remind individuals that their actions can impact the community as a whole.
 
How it works
When the security team observes that groups or individuals within specific spaces are breaking the Covid-19 rules, a yellow warning will be issued in the form of a poster displayed in the area. The second instance of rule-breaking will result in this being replaced with an orange warning poster.
 
A red warning poster will be issued if the rules are broken a third time, placing the area in immediate quarantine. This quarantine will last for five days, including any Saturday openings. If this affects a workspace, students and tutors will be told to leave and work online from that moment.
 
This system will remain in place until the rules are being followed or the government loosens its regulations. Unfortunately, this is the only way we can provide students, tutors and staff with a safe environment.
 
The rules
The rules you must follow within the Academy have been communicated multiple times, and there are also reminders within the building in the form of posters. But for anyone who still is not sure, here are the basics:
 
•  Wear a mask when moving around 
•  Maintain a 1.5-metre distance from other people at all times
•  Stay home and get tested if you have any symptoms
•  Use the one-way system on the stairs
•  Check-in at the student entrance
 
These apply to students, workshop instructors, staff, tutors, heads, studio leaders, coordinators and anyone else in the building. Don’t hesitate to remind your colleagues and other community members if they forget.
 
Please remember that vaccination against Covid-19 does not prevent you from transferring it to others and follow the rules whether you have been vaccinated or not.
 
Mask-wearing is compulsory while moving around, but wearing a mask while seated is a personal decision. This is in line with the measures put in place by the government. Under no circumstances is it appropriate for tutors, staff or students to ask anyone within the community to remove a mask while in the building, even if it is hard to understand what someone is saying. 
 
The 1.5-metre distancing rule must be observed at all times. This means it is not generally possible for a whole department to gather around one table. Please remind each other of this rule if circumstances require it.
 
Tutors, Coordinators, Heads and Studio Leaders
The BA teaching team met last night with Janneke, and the MA teaching team has been invited to a lunch meeting with Ilse to explain the new system and discuss how to maintain our hybrid approach to education if spaces are closed.
 
Tutors, Heads and Studio Leaders whose teaching spaces are quarantined should report to Janneke or Ilse to discuss when teaching can start onsite again. During the quarantine period, all teaching will take place online.

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE: 9 Mar. 2021 - Crowd-control system & security

We are disappointed to have to write to you today with an update on the new Covid-19 security measures we are putting in place within the school to keep everyone safe. 
 
We hoped to avoid this through a sense of collective responsibility, but thanks to a few individuals – both students and tutors – we must now bring in stricter measures to keep the Academy open as a resource for as many people as possible.

The Netherlands is currently at risk of a ‘third wave’ of Covid-19 infections. Until the vaccination programme has protected a significant proportion of the population, we must be vigilant – particularly with the arrival of new strains of the virus. 

Last night, the government announced it would extend the current curfew until 04.30 on Wednesday 31 March and continue with the existing restrictions. You can find these on the government website [here](https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19)
 
Covid-19 Security 
We will have a temporary security team in the building this week and the upcoming three weeks, monitoring the spaces and ensuring that the rules are followed. 
 
These individuals can be clearly identified through their uniform – a black suit and purple tie – and will approach anyone breaking the rules to remind them of what they should be doing. 
We hope that they will help support everyone in understanding and following the rules. If effective, they will remain in place until the rules can be lifted. 
 
However, if safety remains an issue, we will consider a stronger approach, with a “red card” penalty system and temporary suspensions or an alternative quarantine system. 
 
As a reminder, when in the building, you must always:
 - Wear a mask when moving around
 - Maintain a 1.5-metre distance from other people at all times
 - Use the one-way system on the stairs
 -  Check-in at the student entrance
 - Return any digital keys and access codes after use and respect the booking system
 
This applies to students, workshop instructors, staff, tutors, heads, studio leaders, coordinators and anyone else in the building.
Our strategy was discussed with BA and MA students in online meetings with student counsellor Olga Pullens last week. Thank you to everyone who attended. We learned a lot about the experience within the school at the moment and which topics led to confusion.
 
The Dutch regulations may not be in sync with the regulations in different home countries. For this we will give staff and tutors extra clear updates on the rules in place within the Academy. In addition, we have already taken steps towards reminders posted in the building and tutor updates sent from the BA and MA coordinators.
 
Several other questions arose. Some immediate answers are below, and we are looking further into various issues, including the provision of adequate space in studios, the availability of printing facilities at TAC, over-scheduling of student meetings, fixed tables for BA floors and the experience of students who are joining classes online that take place within the Academy. 
 
Masks and Distancing
Mask-wearing is compulsory while moving around, but wearing a mask while seated is a personal decision. This is in line with the measures put in place by the government. Under no circumstances is it appropriate for tutors, staff or students to ask anyone within the community to remove a mask while in the building, even if it is hard to understand what someone is saying. 
 
The 1.5-metre distancing rule must be observed at all times. This means it is not generally possible for a whole department to gather around one table. Please remind each other of this rule if circumstances require it. 
 
Digital Workshop
To control numbers in the Digital Workshop, a key system is in place. Students MUST return their key when they finish using the space. 
 
There have been repeated incidents where students have taken keys away from the workshop and passed them on to other students instead of returning them. This creates a variety of access issues.
 
Schedule
Some students addressed it is not clear to them when they can use the building. This has been communicated via the educational desk and coordinators. We will publish the full outline in the Student Information area of the DAE website’s Covid-19 section for full clarity.
Access to the workshops on pre-scheduled Saturdays is only on a first-come-first-served basis for BA and MA. Maximum workshop occupancy varies from one workshop to another to ensure that there is enough space for the Foundation Year students. If you have been at DAE in the same week according to your schedule, you may also use the workspaces on pre-scheduled Saturdays. Due to square m2 at the MA floor they can always use the workspaces on pre-scheduled Saturdays.
 
Testing
DAE has investigated the possibility of introducing regular, rapid testing for our community. However, at the moment, we do not have the financial support for this. The Dutch government stated they are looking into expanding the capacity for quick tests in education as this can contribute to the rapid expansion of physical education. We will make sure to follow these developments closely.
Anyone who has any of the known symptoms can request a free test via the [government’s booking system](https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-test)
 
Individuals can also book a test with a private provider, but these must also be paid for privately. 
If you feel unwell, do not come into the school building, stay at home and request a test. If you have any questions or doubts, you can always contact the school’s counsellor, who will help in any way they can. 
 
Mental Health
We know that the longer this all goes on, the more difficult it becomes. Many of us have never been apart from our friends, family, and support systems for this long. DAE has staff in place to support students and staff through challenging moments, including our student counsellor Olga Pullens, <olga.pullens@designacademy.nl>, and BA mentor Mona Smits, <mona.smits@designacademy.nl>.
Mental health is health. Like any other health issue, it can become worse if ignored for too long. Do not hesitate to get in touch with any member of the DAE team you feel comfortable talking to if you are struggling in any way. 
 
Sports
As of 16 March the possibilities to sport within the Netherlands will be extended. Adults of 27 years and older may play sports outside on sports facilities with a maximum of 4 people. The condition is that they keep a 1.5 metre distance. Up to 26 years old, sports at sports facilities were already allowed, in teams, without keeping a distance of 1.5 metres.
 
Travel
Travelers from countries outside the EU are subject to an entry ban. The list of exceptions is applicable again. This means that the following groups may again enter the Netherlands as of 16 March, amongst others: business travelers, students, professionals from the cultural and creative sector
 
Reconnecting
Both Olga and other staff who joined the meetings last week have told us that seeing so many student faces was a strong reminder about how special our community is, how challenging this period has been, and what we are trying to achieve. 
 
Learning from this experience, we hope to find more ways to bring us all together and keep this connection alive for everyone. Anyone with thoughts or suggestions around this idea can drop us an email at <executiveboard@designacademy.nl> – all input is welcome. 
 
On 23 March, there will be another press conference.
We will be in touch soon with more information.

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE: 24 Feb. 2021

Spring is finally in the air, and we hope you are all able to enjoy a bit of sunshine this week. We know that the restrictions in the Netherlands and elsewhere in the world are testing everyone’s resilience, both physically and mentally. The longer the pandemic continues, the more difficult it becomes. A year has passed, and the social and economic effects are mounting dramatically. But the first signs of a new season also bring new reasons to be hopeful.
 
The Dutch Government has decided that it is worth taking a considered risk with a very limited first step towards relaxing the current lockdown. From 3 March, young people aged 26 and below will be able to train together outside at sports venues, contact-based professions will be allowed to start practicing again, and retailers can open for shopping-by-appointment.

Every single one of us is individually responsible for the collective health of the society around us. This is just as true inside the DAE building as anywhere else. When you use the building, your behaviour directly impacts the level of risk for everyone else and whether your department can remain open.
 
Despite this and repeated warnings, there are still individuals who do not seem able to follow the rules. This forces us to introduce a new system for crowd control, which will come into effect on 8 March. Everyone will receive an invitation for next week to attend a mandatory Teams meeting about this plan. 
 
As the government looks to relax the Covid-19 restrictions, it is more important than ever that we all pay extra attention to the basic rules for limiting the spread of the virus. This means frequent hand washing, sneezing into your elbow and wearing a face mask wherever required, staying 1.5 meters away from others and avoiding busy places.
 
It’s also essential that even those with mild symptoms are tested and stay at home until they receive a negative test result. If you test positive for Covid-19, you must self-quarantine with everyone in your household. 
 
On 8 March, the government will reassess the situation. We will update you if there are any significant changes. Hopefully, if we all contribute to the control of the virus through our actions, we will have more freedom soon.
 
All other aspects of the lockdown and curfew will remain in force until at least 15 March. This means that all current measures within the education still stay intact at DAE.

The flight ban introduced on 23 January also remains in place. Please check the government website for more details on this: <https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/visiting-the-netherlands-from-abroad/dutch-flight-ban-and-docking-ban>

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE: 17 Feb. 2021

We are very happy to have been able to slowly reopen the Academy as a resource for students over the past few days and to see many of you making use of the space.
 
But we are very concerned that the rules around distancing and mask-wearing are already being broken. Several students and staff have said that they have not felt safe.
 
We cannot keep the Academy building open to all if this continues. We know that following the rules is not always easy and that sometimes we all act on instinct without thinking. However, it would be extremely sad if groups could no longer use the space due to the actions of a few individuals.
 
We must follow government guidelines, but it also our collective responsibility as a community to keep each other safe, especially in these strange circumstances. 

PLEASE BE THOUGHTFUL AND RESPECTFUL WHEN USING THE BUILDING.
 
As a reminder, when inside the Academy:
 

 - Observe a minimum 1.5-metre distance between individuals
 - Wear a mask
 - Enter through the student entrance and check-in at the desk
 - Use the one-way system on the stairs
 - Only access the workshops if you have booked a slot via the app
 
Curfew continues
We are also aware of some confusion about recent reports relating to the curfew in the Netherlands. As of this morning, the curfew is still in place. You can find more information about the curfew in our previous update posted on the DAE website.
 
There is an ongoing legal battle around this issue, and we will update you if the situation changes.

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE: 10 Feb. 2021

From 15 February, DAE will move towards a hybrid form of education, blending online teaching and on-site practical work. This will remain in place until the summer, assuming that the government does not tighten the COVID-19 regulations any further.

We know that the challenges of the past few months have been emphasised by the lack of certainty and the lack of access to spaces for making, so we have been keen to provide everyone with a consistent, safe solution. 
We are very pleased to finally have found a way forward that is possible within the existing COVID-19 measures. This is thanks to the hard work of the BA and MA coordinators, who have developed various scenarios for the different groups that need to use the building. 

Our aim is to make the Academy available as a resource for those who need it and feel safe using the space. Support staff will continue to work from home. Teaching staff will be invited to switch between on-site and online education as they feel appropriate. We know how important it is for students to be able to access workshops and teaching spaces, so we are very thankful to all ​the workshop instructors, concierges, Library and ZBar staff who have helped making this possible.

Phased access
Different access scenarios for different student groups will be shared with the student body today by the educational desk. Each group will also receive a full verbal explanation in a series of meetings. Every member of the student body will receive – or has already received – an invite to a meeting from the educational desk in your inbox (look for emails from <bachelors@designacademy.nl> and <masters@designacademy.nl>).

Students entering the building must check-in at the desk at the student entrance. We will no longer work with the recently adopted workspaces app – access will be granted based on the presentation of student cards, so don’t forget to bring it with you if you are using the building. Tutors and staff should also notify their presence at the entrance desk so that we can monitor movement within the Academy.

Access to the workshops will continue to be arranged via the workshops app, and the current opening hours for the workshops, library and workspaces will be maintained for as long as the curfew is in effect. Please remember to cancel your workshop slot if you no longer need it, as spaces are limited.

We are working on improving internal communication between the workshop staff and students. In the meantime, if students have any questions for the workshops concerning tools or materials, you can contact them via email using the details on the [workshop page](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/workshops).

Curfew continues
The government has extended the existing curfew until 04:30 on Wednesday 3 March. DAE will continue to close at 18:00 during this period. All other protocols remain in place. 

Quarantine protocol
With more people likely to be using the building, it is important to know that there is a strict quarantine policy in place. In the case of a confirmed COVID-19 infection within the DAE community, all teaching staff and students who have been in close contact with the individual must go into quarantine for a minimum of five days. After the first five days, they can be tested for the virus, but this is voluntary. If they choose not to be tested, they must remain in quarantine for a further five days. DAE will provide remote education to any affected students during the quarantine period wherever possible.

Saturday opening
The Academy will be open on pre-scheduled Saturdays from 20 February onwards, to facilitate the practical elements of DAE’s Foundation Year and pre-courses.

Students will have the opportunity to enter the bachelor and master spaces and are able to use some of the workshops on these Saturdays, and slots can be booked via the workshop app. Opening hours on Saturday are 09:00 to 16:30.

Beyond Eindhoven
We are aware that some students have chosen to remain in their home country during these uncertain times, or have been unable to travel back to the Netherlands due to travel restrictions. 

Although we have focused on physical access to the Academy in recent communications, we are also continually evaluating the quality of our online education and the expectations placed on students in terms of the work they need to produce while struggling with limited access to tutors, collaborators and workspaces. 

We are continually impressed by your adaptability and ingenuity under these circumstances and look forward to being together again soon to share the knowledge we have gained from these unique experiences.  

In the Netherlands, we have just experienced a few days of snow. We hope you have been able to enjoy it. It is going to remain cold, with temperatures below freezing for the next few days. If you would like to try ice skating or other winter sports, please stay safe and remember the COVID-19 regulations for outdoor sports: only go out with members of your household or one other adult and maintain the 1.5-metre rule for social distancing. And have fun!

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE: 3 Feb. 2021

It is only February, but already this year has thrown plenty of new challenges our way! Thank you for bearing with us as we responded to the unrest in Eindhoven last week and the introduction of the curfew in the Netherlands.
 
There are now at least two strains of Covid-19 in the Netherlands. While confirmed cases related to the original strain appear to be going down, the new variant identified in recent weeks has a much higher infection rate. This means it has the potential to affect more people, much faster. We must continue to be vigilant in our efforts to control the virus.
 
Yesterday, the Dutch government announced some small changes to the current Covid-19 measures. The curfew remains in place. Non-essential shops are still closed, but it is possible to pick up orders at pre-arranged times. In addition, primary schools and childcare will be able to reopen next week. This will ease the intense pressure experienced by some of our staff over the last few weeks, who have been juggling homeschooling and work. They have achieved more than we could have imagined and we are very grateful to all of them.
 
DAE’s staff have been working in the background to try and give as many students access to the Academy building as possible while keeping everyone safe. We are able to share some initial details below. We hope that we’ll be able to maintain this arrangement towards summer or until lockdown lifts, but of course this depends on no further restrictions from the government.
 
We are aware that a large number of students have chosen to remain in their home country or have been unable to travel back to the Netherlands due to travel restrictions. Please know that we are also continually evaluating the quality of our online education, the issues caused by lack of access to tutors and workspaces, and the expectations placed on students in terms of the work they need to produce.
 
Phased access to the Academy building
Building on the current set-up, which already gives some students access to the workshops and workplaces to prepare for exams, the BA and MA coordinators have been putting together a detailed plan to reopen the building for all current students.
 
To make sure we can do this within the guidelines for essential on-site education set by the government for universities of applied science (HBOs), this will take place in phases. Teaching staff will be invited to consider a hybrid approach, switching between on-site and online education as they feel appropriate.  
 
There will be no pressure on either students or staff to travel or to use the workshops and building. Our aim is to make it available as a resource for those who really need it and feel safe using the space. Support staff will continue to work from home. More information on this will be shared towards the end of next week.
 
The success of this plan depends entirely on everyone’s compliance with the current rules around distancing, hand-washing and the wearing of masks inside the Academy building at all times. To protect both students and staff, DAE will introduce closer monitoring within the school. With more people likely to be using the building, DAE will be introducing a stricter quarantine policy. This will be fully outlined in the coming days.
 
We know that this time of year can feel especially challenging even under normal circumstances. We are all looking forward to Spring more than ever. Please remember that no one in this community is alone and don’t hesitate to get in touch if you need someone to talk to.

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE: 22 Jan. 2021

Yesterday, the Dutch government responded to growing concerns about the presence of new strains of Covid-19 in the Netherlands by setting in place stricter rules for the current lockdown and outlining plans to introduce a curfew and travel bans.

We want to reassure students about to sit their exams that these will still take place as planned. Although the government has asked most educational institutions to provide teaching remotely until at least 7 February, it is allowing higher professional education institutions (HBOs) like DAE to offer exams and practical on-site training.
This means that students with upcoming end-terms and final exams can also still access the workshops via the app booking system as outlined in our last email, which is also available on the DAE website in our dedicated Covid-19 area.

We are currently preparing for a variety of scenarios that might be possible after 7 February 2021. This includes looking into ways we might be able to open up the work spaces for more students, within the parameters defined by the government.

By following the rules, we have managed to keep the Academy building safe. Please remember that our librarian, workshop teams and concierges are taking the risk of coming into the Academy building daily to make sure that students at key moments in their education can still access the facilities. Don’t forget to maintain the 1.5-meter distancing rule, wear a mask and wash your hands whenever you come to DAE.

— Curfew
This afternoon the Dutch parliament approved the government’s plans for a curfew and will put into effect from upcoming Saturday onwards. The curfew will be in effect from 21:00 until 4:30 every night and is expected to be in place until 10 February.

The aim is to stop people from visiting each other and gathering in groups. During the curfew you may only go outside in the case of an emergency (this includes urgent medical issues, urgent veterinary assistance for pets or cases where you need to provide emergency assistance to someone else), if your employer needs you to leave home for work, you are travelling out of or returning to the Netherlands, you are travelling to or returning from a funeral, you are travelling in connection to a court summons, you are walking a dog on a lead. If you are walking a dog, you must do this alone.

In any of these cases, you need to take a ‘curfew declaration’ with you. If you are outside for work reasons, you must also have an ‘employer’s declaration’. More information on these forms can be found here [www.rijksoverheid.nl/avondklok](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/avondklok). More information will be posted on the government’s website once the curfew is approved.

In light of this, the workshops will close Monday -Thursday at 18:00 as long as the curfew is in effect. The Academy building will close completely at 18:30. Closure on Friday remains as it is now. This should give students and staff enough time to get home before 21:00.

Reservations for time in the workshops and library can only be made via the [DAE Workshops App](https://apps.powerapps.com/play/d6fc9223-989b-40aa-a8ab-f23bbc666891?tenantId=2c1cfd24-625c-489e-b1fc-8f745830ea67), [Library app](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.powerapps.com%2Fplay%2F3ffc5c9f-3291-4919-8d74-8dc54ca74b1b%3FtenantId%3D2c1cfd24-625c-489e-b1fc-8f745830ea67&data=02%7C01%7C%7C18e414c00bce408bbfa908d8435f5464%7Cafca0a52882c4fa8b71df6db2e36058b%7C0%7C0%7C637333424015146637&sdata=btOPAULOk30BJE5CYTvaGTo4CrxXxrKxFe%2F8vhW3BlE%3D&reserved=0) or download the Power App in the Apple Store or Google Play Store. You must have your student card with you to be able to check-in for your reserved time slot.

Workshop employees and concierges will be able to request an employer’s certificate from DAE’s HR team if this is needed.

If using the work spaces, you must register at the check-in desk before you enter your department floor. A maximum of five students per department are allowed on the department floor at any time. You must have your student card with you to be able to check-in.

Travel
The government has asked everyone in the Netherlands not to travel and book no new trips until after 31 March. From midnight on 23 January, flights and passenger ferries from the UK will be banned from arriving in the Netherlands. The flight ban will also apply to passenger flights from South Africa, Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Cape Verde, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela. This is expected to be in effect for up to one month, or until the planned mandatory quarantine for travellers has been legally regulated.

Anyone travelling to the Netherlands from a “high-risk” area will now also be required to take a rapid Covid-19 test no more than four hours before they travel. This must have a clear negative result. This is in addition to the existing regulation requiring a negative result from a PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arriving in the Netherlands.

Anyone arriving in the Netherlands for any reason and from any location must go into quarantine. After the first five days of quarantine, they can be tested for Covid-19, and if the result is negative, they will no longer be required to isolate.

Students, professionals from the cultural and creative sector and long-distance lovers who come for a short stay will no longer be allowed to enter the Netherlands.
This may directly impact our community members who need to travel home and on the ability of tutors to attend exams in person.

Increased restrictions
The government has tightened its guidelines on visitors at home. You must have no more than one visitor over the age of 13 in one day. You should not visit more than one other household in one day. Only go outside with members of your own household and with no more than one other person.
DAE’s staff are already working from home wherever possible. We must urge students to avoid any in-person meetings if you are collaborating on projects for the time being. If you are currently completing your internship and have any concerns about your workplace or safety, please contact the student counsellor Olga Pullens.

We know that collaborating online can sometimes be frustrating and produces different results to in-person meetings, but these measures are an important tool in protecting the most vulnerable members of our society. We must all play our part in this effort, or risk undermining the sacrifices being made by our peers, colleagues and communities. We will not be in lockdown forever.

Please make the time to check in on your fellow students, team members and educators this week – for many of us, every message, phone call and Microsoft Teams catchup is an important point of contact at the moment.
Thank you once again to all of you for your stoicism, flexibility and inventiveness. Your ability to create thoughtful, bold and interesting work in these circumstances is inspiring. Good luck to everyone preparing for exams and remember that you are not alone if you are struggling in any way. Don’t hesitate to contact your coordinators, mentors and the DAE counsellors if you need more support or someone to talk to.

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE: 13 Jan. 2021

As you may know, yesterday the Dutch Government announced an extension of the current lockdown to control the spread of Covid-19 in the Netherlands until at least 9 February.
 
The number of confirmed Covid-19 infections is falling, but the healthcare system is still overstretched and Intensive Care Units are struggling. The government is now assessing the potential impact of new variants of the virus, and the rollout of the vaccination scheme in the Netherlands has only just begun.
 
It is essential that we continue to do whatever we can to play our part in protecting our own community and the communities around us. This means we must all continue to work from home, limit our contact with other people in the physical world, only travel if it is necessary (including within the Netherlands), and observe the testing and [quarantine policy](https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/visiting-the-netherlands-from-abroad) strictly if we do leave and re-enter the country.
 
The DAE building must remain closed to the majority of students and staff for now. However, we have set into motion plans to make the workshops and workfloor accessible for a limited amount of students, namely those that are approaching their end-terms and re-dos. We remain the situation as it is for those about to take their final exams for graduation! We are currently planning to go ahead with the BA Graduation on the 26 January.
 
This is dependent on no further restrictions from the government and relies on everyone sharing the responsibility for keeping the virus out of the school building. If any of our team become sick, the impact will be significant, so please don’t forget to wash your hands, wear a mask and stay away if you feel unwell.
 
The Educational Desk will send an invite for online BA and MA student meetings with staff, coordinators and study coaches to make sure everything is clear. More details are below, but please don’t hesitate to contact your coordinator if you are uncertain about anything. 
 
We expect to send another update in the first week of February. Meanwhile we will explore how we can further structure the phased reopening of the school after 8 February 2021, within the context of COVID 19 developments and the further guidelines to be taken by the government. Thank you for your patience, perseverance and ingenuity, and good luck to all students with exams and end-terms coming up.
 
Look out for each other, keep in touch, and stay safe.

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE: 14 Dec. 2020

We have learned that the Dutch government is expected to make an announcement tonight introducing a sudden, stricter lockdown across the country. This will probably include closing all schools from this Wednesday until 19 January 2021.

Only essential shops will be allowed to remain open (supermarkets, grocery shops, pharmacies and banks). All schools will be asked to switch to online education. The new rules are likely to come into effect from midnight tonight to avoid a run on shops tomorrow. Prime Minister Rutte is due to address the country at 19:00, confirming this decision. 

In anticipation of this, we want to share with you the plans we have in place for students and staff. We hope that by letting you know in advance, we can help cushion the impact. Our approach is informed by everything we have learned over the last year of lockdowns and measures, as well as practical considerations around scheduling and the availability of space and people. 

If new measures are introduced as expected, then the following will apply;

1. DAE will close until 19 January 2021, but education will continue online this week. Education programmes will then take place online from 4 Jan 2021 until the school can reopen.

We must ask any students who have decided to travel abroad against the official advice to ensure that they observe a minimum quarantine period of 10 days on their return. This means you must be back in the Netherlands by 10 Jan 2021 at the latest.

2. The workshops will close as of tomorrow. Exceptions will be made for the BA students due to finish in January and March, who will be able to access the workshops from 4 January 2021 via a reservation system. 

3. Items can be collected from the Academy building up to and including tomorrow. Please note that there will be an extra door policy per floor and location in the building to prevent crowds and contamination.

4. Employees will return to working from home full time (except the workshop instructors and concierges), using the online environment. Holidays will remain as planned. 

5. Staff, heads, teachers and coordinators have collectively agreed to keep the school open as much as possible during the lockdown to give graduating students access to workshops and education spaces.

Bachelor students who are scheduled to graduate in January can still sit their exam, or can postpone it to 15 March 2021 if they prefer. 

An online meeting with Olga (student counsellor), Janneke (coordinator BA), Allard (coordinator workshops) and Stijn (coordinator graduates) will take place this evening at 18:30 to make sure everything is clear. 

The Festive Graduation Ceremony and photoshoot for all graduates will take place in June.

6. If necessary, more information will be shared via the department coordinators. Please check the Covid-19 Q&As on the DAE website regularly for updates.

7. The Teachers’ Day that was planned for 17 December will be rescheduled to March 2021. 

8. The BA Open Day, Experience Day and Admissions had already been changed to online and will continue as planned. 

9. The MA Meet the Masters and Talk&Tour events had already been changed to online and will continue as planned. 

10. The Student Council has been given a budget by the Executive Board to organise initiatives for students staying in Eindhoven. Any plans will now have to take the new measures into account. This means:

Compulsory use of mouth masks
Observing the 1.5m distance regulation
A maximum of two visitors are allowed per household both indoors and outdoors, with an exception for Christmas when this increases to three people.  
The government’s decision to introduce these measures suddenly is a response to the increasing pressure on the Dutch healthcare system, as cases have continued to increase. For now, it does not seem that a curfew will be introduced. We will keep you updated and let you know if we hear of any further changes as they are announced.

Information about how teaching will be affected within each department and course will be shared via coordinators and/or the education desk but some of this is included below for your reference as well. 

We are sorry that the year is coming to such an abrupt end. We know that it’s been a challenging period. We hope that you can all find something positive in these extra days at home and look forward immensely to seeing you all again soon and a new year full of promise.

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE: 20 Nov. 2020

# An extraordinary festive season

This festive season is going to be very different for all of us. Many of us will be away from our friends and family. This will not be easy.

But there is good news – the number of new cases of COVID-19 in the Netherlands is falling. We want to say thank you to everyone at DAE who has played a part in the collective action that was needed to make this happen. The Dutch government has been able to lift some restrictions as a result, and we have been able to keep our building open. We know how important it is for all of you to be able to access workshops and teaching spaces, so we are very thankful to all ​the tutors and staff who have helped make this possible. 

However, unnecessary travel is still discouraged by the government. This means we sadly have to suggest that you all remain in the Netherlands over the holidays instead of travelling. Many of us at DAE have been away from the people we love for an unprecedented amount of time, and – while it might be the right thing to do – deciding not to travel may mean you cannot see them during the festive season. We know that this is hard. You are not on your own in this. Both our counsellor Olga Pullens and our mentor Mona Smits are available if you need support.

If you do still decide to travel, please be careful for your own sake and the sake of our community. Observe the guidance on distancing and mouth coverings, follow the rules wherever you are, and take sensible precautions. You will need to be back in Eindhoven by 3 January 2021, when teaching begins again. 

We have decided to partially close from 4 January until 12 January. This is not an extra holiday! All education will be online. Students will be expected to be in the Netherlands and must attend all of their tutorials, lectures and teaching sessions virtually. 

As we aim to be able to continue with on-site education in the long term, we need to do everything we can to reduce the chance of COVID-19 entering the school. We are closing the building as a precaution, providing plenty of time for necessary quarantines if any of our students, tutors or staff do decide to travel. 

Partial exceptions will be made for students who are preparing for their exams in January, but only if they have not travelled or have observed the mandatory quarantine period. They will be allowed to access the workshops from 4 January until 12 January. A small number of students, tutors and heads will also be able to access the building for the MA Talk & Tour and Early Admissions programme for prospective students, which will be an online event. 

From 13 January, we will be happy to welcome you all back to DAE. 

Best wishes,
Executive Board,
Raf, Joseph and Mechtild

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE: 18 Nov. 2020

# Partial lockdown continues

The number of coronavirus infections in the Netherlands is now falling, which is very good news! This is the result of a collective effort to follow the rules and protect each other. But we still face a period of restriction to ensure that these numbers continue to decrease. 

Last Tuesday the Dutch government announced new measures that allow us a bit more freedom. Museums, theatres, swimming pools and amusement parks can reopen, and group sports lessons can resume. 

People can receive a maximum of three visitors at their homes each day. Outdoors, groups of no more than four people will be allowed. This is very welcome for those of us who feel the strain of not seeing friends and colleagues.  

The 1.5-metre distancing rule remains in effect. You are advised to leave places if they become too busy to maintain this. You are also strongly advised to wear a face mask in indoor public spaces. From 1 December, anyone will be able to get a Coronavirus test if they have been exposed or are at risk of infection, even if they have no symptoms. 

The government has not yet decided which measures will apply around Christmas and New Year. They are still advising against all non-essential foreign travel until mid-January. Again, we feel incredibly sad to have to discourage you from travelling, especially with the festive season approaching. Many of us are struggling with the impact of having been away from friends and family for a long time and the coming weeks may involve some difficult decisions around travel. Both our counsellor Olga Pullens and our mentor Mona Smits are available if you need support. Please know you are not alone in this. 

Hopefully, it will be possible to find creative solutions for traditional festivities. Plans are currently being drawn up for education from 4 January onwards at DAE and will be shared soon. 

All the best,
Executive Board
Joseph, Raf, Mechtild

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE: 4 Nov. 2020

# Lockdown tightens but DAE remains open

The number of new Coronavirus infections in the Netherlands is stabilising, thanks to collective action. We are on the right path, but these numbers need to drop and they need to drop fast if we want more freedom of movement and activity in our daily lives and release the pressure on our healthcare system. 

This is why the Dutch government has decided to introduce additional restrictions for the next two weeks. The aim is to increase the impact of the existing partial lockdown, which has been in place since 14 October. The extra measures will be in place until at least 19 November. Unnecessary travel movements are discouraged until January 15, 2021.

## You can read more about the measurements here:

English [Eindhovennews.com](https://eindhovennews.com/corona/2020/11/covid-19-more-closures-and-rules-for-at-least-the-next-2-weeks or via [NOS Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/NOSinEnglish) or in Dutch on [Rijksoverheid.nl](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/).

There is still a high risk of infection – currently, one in six people tested for coronavirus in the Netherlands tests positive – so it is crucial that everyone meets the measures that are already in place as well as the new ones. We must all play our part in this.

## Key additional measures include:

All venues, which are normally open to the public, will close, including museums, theatres, cinemas, amusement parks, swimming pools and libraries. It is allowed to remain our library within DAE open.

People aged 18 and older may only take part in sports individually or in groups of two. 

You may receive no more than two people a day in your home.

The maximum group size outdoors and indoors (except in your home) is two people from different households. This means that you can even be fined (!) if you stand with more than two people outside the entrance of the school.

Sadly, one of the most immediate impacts of these new measures is the closure of our exhibition at the Van Abbemuseum, GEO–DESIGN; Sand.

Fortunately, DAE remains open, which we are grateful for, as we know access to workshops and teaching spaces is essential for our students. But we have to urge each of you to stay at home as much as possible and avoid non-essential travel.
We feel incredibly sad to have to discourage you from travelling, especially now with the festive season approaching. Many of us have been away from friends and family for a long time and will have to make difficult decisions in the coming weeks. Both our counsellor Olga Pullens and our mentor Mona Smits are available if you need support in this. Please do know you are not on your own in this.

By next week, at the very latest, we will be able to share (further) guidelines for education at DAE and explain how we will organise lessons, tutorials and other teaching formats from January 4th onwards.

All the best,
Executive Board
Joseph, Raf, Mechtild

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE: 14 Oct. 2020

# School Closure: Not Yet!

As you may already be aware, the rate of Covid-19 infections in the Netherlands has been increasing at a rapid rate. This means that Design Academy Eindhoven must introduce new measures in our efforts to keep everyone in our community safe. 

The good news is that, for the moment, we can remain open! However, it is increasingly important that we all respect the rules and regulations. So far, this appears to be proving challenging for some individuals within the Academy, particularly in terms of maintaining the 1.5-metre distancing rule. So we would like to take this opportunity to also remind you of the existing regulations. 

If you are uncertain about the rules, you can always check the [Q&A](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/covid-19-qanda) on our new website, which will be updated this week.  

We know that these are difficult times and that it is hard to remember to maintain a distance from friends and colleagues when this goes against our instincts. But the only way we will successfully navigate these extraordinary conditions is together. If we can collectively respect the rules and help remind each other when we forget them, we will be able to stay together for now. 

 

## New mandatory rule: Facemasks in the Academy building
From tomorrow, the wearing of facemasks in the Academy building will be mandatory for anyone moving around the building. This means that if you are not sitting down you must be wearing a mask. 
This is in addition to the 1.5-metre distancing rule. Whether you are wearing a facemask or not, you must still maintain the correct distance from your fellow students and colleagues. 
This is in line with the Dutch government's current rules.


## Enforcement
If we as a community cannot follow our own regulations, then the school may have to close. Or in terms of enforcement, we will start closing certain part of the school if measurements seem to be most difficult to respect, for instance in the Z-bar. 

To try and prevent this we will actively enforce our regulations by closing parts of the school where it seems to be the most difficult to follow the rules. We will only do this if distancing continues to be an issue and if the new facemask rule is not followed. We hope this can be avoided and that everyone will play their part. 

For now, the government wants educational institutions to stay open, and we are grateful to be able to continue onsite education. However, the government may extend its extreme measures to include education in two to four weeks. If this happens, we are prepared to adapt and continue our programme online and find new and interesting avenues to explore together.


## Travelling to and from school and work
→ Educational staff:
If you can give onsite lessons, you are allowed to travel to and from DAE (necessary travels). Please wear a facemask and maintain distancing. If you can’t teach in the Academy building for any reason, you should switch to online education. Please discuss this with your coordinator, head or studio leader and/or programme coordinator.

→ Instructors of the workshop and students: 
It is obvious our instructors have to be in their respective workshops. So please respect that the workshops can accommodate fewer students at a time, maintain distancing and wear a facemask.

→ Support staff: 
While we must all do our bit to help control the infection rates, it is also important to ensure our colleagues in education are supported. However, if your work doesn’t have to take place at the Academy, please work from home. If you need to come in, there is ample space to work on the second floor and maintain distancing.

 

You can read the latest regulations and updates from the Dutch government here: [https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands](https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands)

 

## Questions & Help
Please don’t hesitate to contact your heads, coordinators, managers or whoever is most appropriate if you have any questions, worries or need help determining how best to continue with your projects, work and studies. We have included details for the relevant contacts:

If you are a student and you have any questions that are not covered by the [Q&A](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/covid-19-qanda) on the DAE website, please consult the coordinator of the department or Olga Pullens (Dean) (+31 6 44594717).

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE #12

The start of the new academic year is just around the corner, and we’ve been working hard to ensure that everybody, both students and tutors, can take part in the education process again. This letter explains a number of new rules that we have put in place to facilitate on-site education. 

Main changes to facilitate on-site education: 
1. The layout of the floors has been altered, and all spaces normally used for exhibitions, lectures and assessments will now be mainly used for education. This is a total of 3,500 m2 (WitteDame Hall, MU Space, and second half of 3rd floor).  
2. The support staff has moved to the second floor, which is also more accessible to students. 
3. In response to current corona protocols, we have introduced a number of measures such as time slots and strictly scheduled times to enter the building and use the workshops. Following the rules will allow us to make education possible for everybody. 

This email lists all the new measures. Please read them carefully and be sure to follow them. Thank you in advance. 

Let us work TOGETHER to make on-site education possible and to remain possible! 

Best wishes,  
The Executive Board 
Joseph, Raf and Mechtild 
 


General measures 
The ‘Measures announced by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) to combat the spread of COVID-19’ guide the actions of DAE. We will adopt these measures. If you think you have COVID-19, please phone 0800-1202 or go to coronatest.nl (make sure you have your DigiD at hand) to make an appointment for a test. The most important RIVM recommendations in the Netherlands are:  
 
* Wash your hands often.  
* Cough and sneeze into your elbow.  
* Use paper tissues to blow your nose.  
* Don’t shake hands with others.  
* Stay 1.5 metres away from other people. 
During the press conference on 18 August, the following rules were added: 
- Do not invite more than 6 visitors into your home (in combination with 1,5 m distance) 
- Work from home if possible.  
- If you have symptoms, stay at home! And if a member of your household or family has tested positive for coronavirus, you should self-quarantine. 
- The quarantine period is 10 days. 

 

Specific DAE measures 
BA students time slots
To limit the number of students, tutors and staff in the building at any one time, we are working with time slots for all Bachelor activities. By introducing various starting times, we ensure that the academy is not too busy at the start of the day. The starting times for Bachelor students are 9.30, 10.00 and 10.30, and classes end at 17.30, 18.00 and 18.30. The various starting times mean that break times and finishing times also change. The new time blocks apply from 1 September 2020 to 1 February 2021 and may then change. BA students and staff will receive more information regarding their time slots from the Educational Desk. 

BA students floor layouts
The various floors have been laid out to ensure compliance with all rules. However, it is important that NO furniture (tables chairs, etc.) is moved around. That is because tables and chairs have been positioned to ensure distances of 1.5 metres between people. BA students and staff will receive an email from the Educational Desk with floor plans indicating the location of each group as well as starting, break and finishing times. 

MA students
Master students have their classes on floor 5. Students who do not have a class are requested to work at home as much as possible, unless a flexible workspace is available in the Witte Dame Hall. When using the flexible workspace, please ensure that you respect the 1.5-metre distance. 

Cleaning workplaces/desks
Disinfectant and cleaning wipes are provided on each table. Everybody is requested to disinfect their work surface before using it! 

Disinfectant
Disinfectant dispensers are also located at numerous points throughout the building. Please use them.  

Facemasks
Current regulations in the Netherlands do not make it mandatory to wear facemasks inside places of education. DAE policy is that face masks may be worn inside the Witte Dame building, but they must be purchased or obtained by the wearers themselves. This policy does not apply to the workshops. In consultation with those responsible, protective gear for staff in the workshops can be provided by DAE. Non-medical facemasks must be worn on public transport. Read the FAQ about face masks here:  

https://www.rivm.nl/en/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/face-masks-and-gloves 

zBar  
The zBar is also open to a limited number of visitors. Zbar will work with a system of traffic lights. A red light means ‘wait where you are’ until a green light tells you that space is available. Zbar has been rearranged to ensure 1.5 metres between visitors. Please do not move tables and chairs. A traffic light will be placed on the upper part of main stairwell and another one at the top of the stairs in the zBar. It is not possible to access the zBar by lift. Please do not lunch or hang around on floor 5.5. 

The zBar will have a service point on the ground floor. The payment method at this service point is solely with tokens. The normal zBar will accept all payment methods, including these tokens. The tokens are available for tea/coffee, soup, sandwiches and salads and are only available at the reception desk now located on the ground floor. The reception desk will soon move to floor 2, and you will be informed when this move takes place. You can buy tokens with cash or card but not with your DAE card. Tokens are washed in a dishwasher at the end of the day so that they can be used again safely the next day.  

Please take the stairs; lifts are for select groups only
For everybody at DAE, please follow the one-way circulation system indicated with arrows on the staircases. Lifts may only be used by people with a physical disability and by Zbar staff (1 person at a time). Lifts may be used to move projects, but no more than one person is allowed in the lift at any time.  

Workshops
A limited number of people are allowed in the workshops and library at any one time.

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE #11

We hope that you are enjoying your holidays as much as possible in these strange times. This is an important opportunity for all of us to reflect and reconnect before we tackle the challenges of the next academic year.

Summer closing
On Saturday, DAE will start its two-week summer break. We would like to thank the staff, heads and tutors who have sacrificed their time to make sure that the Academy could open under extraordinary circumstances and give graduating students the opportunity to finish their projects. 
Now they need a break!

DAE will be completely closed from 25 July until 9 August.

We will be back in the second half of August to update you on the latest news and the development of our plans to resume on-site education with social distancing.

Updated Q&A
All of the latest information on how the Coronavirus affects DAE and our community is available in the Q&A on our website. Please have a thorough read of this, even if you have read it before. There are some important additions and changes in the latest update.

Travel advice
If you are travelling over the summer for any reason, please stay safe and try to be back in The Netherlands in the latter half of August so you have plenty of time to quarantine before the Academy reopens.

It is your responsibility to follow the regulations around isolation and quarantine. Details on this can be found in our Q&A. However, if you have a real emergency that means you cannot get back in time to quarantine before 1 September, you can email loket@designacademy.nl.

We are looking forward to welcoming you back to the Academy at the beginning of September.

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE #10

Summer is rapidly approaching and we are all looking forward to enjoying some relaxing weeks. After months of uncertainty and anxiety, it is important to create the time and space to rest and reflect. 

However, it is also going to be a busy couple of months as we explore the realities of the emerging new everyday and what this means for Design Academy Eindhoven and the world beyond. We are optimistic that this period will lead to positive change and reinvention where it is needed. 

Phased re-opening
Our impending graduates are working towards their finals and we are excited to see what they will produce, especially under these extraordinary circumstances. Graduating students have been able to return to the academy since 2 June using a booking system, which allows them access to some of the spaces and tools they need to complete their final projects and exams. 

This is going well. Unfortunately we are still not able to provide our regular education program on-site due to the government’s regulations. 

Next year
Our heads, tutors and staff have been working together to create an adaptable and responsive model for education at DAE. We are committed to restarting on-site education on 7 September 2020, the beginning of the new academic year, although we are still sorting out how exactly this will be working in practical terms. 

The Dutch government is updating its regulations every month and we need to ensure we take this into account. We will be able to begin providing some details around 28 June, with more to follow. 

Opening and graduation day events
There is a possibility that the government will increase the number of people allowed to gather for events from 30 to 100. This would allow us to make the official opening of the academic year on 3 September and our graduation ceremonies on 1 September “blended” events – they will take place simultaneously in the academy building and online so that we can accommodate as many people as possible while conforming to the rules on distancing and keeping everyone safe. 

The graduation day will be split into two parts. The morning will be dedicated to the Masters’ ceremony and the evening to the Bachelors’ ceremony. 

Updates and queries
If you are unsure about how any of the regulations might affect your studies or your work, please check our previous updates and the Q&A on the DAE website, which has been updated this week to reflect the most recent statements from the government and questions we have received from our community. Do not hesitate to get in touch if you have any other concerns. We have included details for the relevant contacts at the end of this update. 

It’s very important we ensure that we keep everyone safe as we begin to reopen. But we are also impatient to be back together soon. We are looking forward to seeing you all again in the next few months. 

 

 

If you are a student and you have any questions that are not covered by the Q&A on the DAE website, please consult the coordinator of the department or Olga Pullens (Dean) (+31 6 44594717).

If you are a tutor and you have any questions, please consult the coordinator of the department or Emke Molnar (HR) (+31 6 83372689).

If you are staff, head or coordinator and you have any questions, please consult your supervisor or Emke Molnar (HR) (+31 6 83372689).

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE #9

The reopening of The Netherlands is continuing as planned – this is very good news as it means that we are also able to follow through with our plans for a phased reopening of DAE, starting with the return of graduating students from 2 June. 

In The Netherlands, we talk about an “intelligent lockdown”. The number of new cases of the COVID-19 virus has flattened but we still face a period of restriction. To be able to begin a limited reopening of the workshops on 2 June and – if necessary – provide limited practical classes (offline) at the Academy for our graduates from 15 June, we have to observe the general preventative measurements for limiting the spread of the virus (distancing, hygiene, spreading of people in the building and travelling to and from the Academy). Above all, the safety and health of students and staff needs to be assured and we will monitor the situation as we reopen and follow the advice of the RIVM. 

To manage returning to DAE in a safe manner, students will be able to reserve time slots for the workshops, the library and for individual workspaces via an app. The link to download this app will be shared as soon as possible in an email from the Educational Desk. In addition to welcoming back graduating students, we will also be opening up to employees from 2 June. Again, we have to organise this carefully to avoid overcrowding. More information will follow. 

Other important dates for our returning graduates are 23 June 2020, when BA and MA exams will take place for those who can do this online. From 24-31 August 2020, BA and MA exams will take place for those who need to use the workshops. And finally, on 1 September 2020, it is our intention to organise a Graduation Ceremony, with the Masters’ graduations in the morning and the Bachelors’ in the evening. We will make sure that these events will be safe and as festive as possible. Re-examinations for those who do not pass during June or August will take place in the second half of September. 

And of course, as mentioned before, we are working very hard towards a Graduation Show and Graduation Catalogue in October. All content for the catalogue will need to be collected before mid-September. For the show, all possible scenarios and locations that fit within the 1.5m protocols are being explored. The Executive Board underlines the importance of the exhibition experience and is committed to give all graduating students a physical show, but is also aware that a show with huge crowds is not part of the reality for the upcoming edition. We are confident the best possible solution will be found and implemented.

Finally, if you come to work at the Academy, you must follow the guidelines as shown on the newly installed posters in the building. We are relying on everyone to take responsibility for themselves and each other and respect and follow these rules. If you wish, you can wear a facemask within DAE – these will not be provided by DAE as they are not mandatory. If possible, please travel by bicycle or on foot to the Academy. From 1 June onwards, it will be obligatory to wear facemasks on all public transport, including the train, tram, bus and metro.

For all other information such as opening hours of the White Lady Building or information for non-graduates please refer to the Q&As. You can find an outline of these plans in our previous update #8

For all of you who will return to DAE at the beginning of the new academic year, we thank you for your patience and we wish you all a good summer. We very much look forward to a phased opening and to welcome all of you back in September.

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE #8

Slowly, The Netherlands is reopening. Last Tuesday the Dutch government announced new measures that allow us a bit more freedom and these will come into effect from 11 May. We have included an outline of the new guidelines and changes below for your reference.

Plans are being drawn up to reopen higher-education institutions specialising in the Applied Sciences. One of the biggest challenges is managing the large number of people involved, with at least 500,000 students and staff who will need to travel to their place of teaching and learning. 

We are looking forward to starting our phased opening soon. These plans have already been shared with you but as a reminder, we will focus first on giving access to students who are due to graduate imminently so that they can complete their final projects and exams.

All other students will return at the start of the next Academic year (for more information please read the previous update).

From 2 June the workshops and library will be open to graduating students, but with limited access to conform with the government’s guidelines. Visiting times can be scheduled via an app. A link to download the app will be shared in an email from the Educational Desk. Final assessments will take place online in June and – hopefully – on location in August.

We are also investigating the idea for a festive ceremony in September that complies with the regulations from the government. 

Student belongings
Do you have anything in the Academy building that you need? You can schedule a time to come and collect your belongings via the app shared in the recent email from the Educational Desk. Nothing has been or will be thrown away!

Returning library books
You can now also hand in library books at the Academy at the temporary reception at the student entrance. Please include a note with your name on it and the titles you are handing in.

Online Café
With Microsoft Teams ‘meeting places’ we have created a space where we can all meet virtually. You will have received an invite to join from the HR-team if you are a member of staff or from the Educational Desk if you are a student.

We hope to use this platform to promote knowledge sharing and provide the opportunity to ask technical questions. On Tuesday 12 May 2020 at 9.30 am the Executive Board will be in the meeting space to answer questions from DAE staff. Don’t miss it!

New students
The Open Day in June will not take place. Applications for 2020-21 admissions are progressing well and we hope, despite all uncertainties, to welcome a new intake of students from September. 

Graduation Show 2020
A dedicated team of Design Academy Alumni is currently working hard to create a beautiful edition of the Graduation Show 2020. We don’t know what the future will bring but we are determined to do everything we can to prepare to deliver the best possible outcome. The Dutch government is expected to make a decision regarding mass spectator events before 1 September.

Please read our updated Q&A on the DAE website to find the latest information on any relevant changes.

We are very much looking forward to seeing you all back at the Academy soon.

 

 

If you are a student and you have any questions that are not covered by the Q&A on the DAE website, please consult the coordinator of the department or Olga Pullens (Dean) (+31 6 44594717).

If you are a tutor and you have any questions, please consult the coordinator of the department or Emke Molnar (HR) (+31 6 83372689).

If you are staff, head or coordinator and you have any questions, please consult your supervisor or Emke Molnar (HR) (+31 6 83372689).

If Emke or Olga cannot be reached directly by phone, please send them a text message.

 

 

Avoid busy places and stay 1.5 metres away from others
From Monday 11 May, we will have a little more freedom, but it will be more important than ever to observe the main rules.

You should continue to do the following:

• Wash your hands.

• Cough and sneeze into your elbow.

• Use paper tissues to blow your nose and discard them after use.

• Don’t shake hands with others.

• Stay 1.5 metres (2 arms lengths) away from other people.

• Work at home if possible.

If you are sick

• Stay at home if you have mild cold-like symptoms, such as a sore throat, a runny nose, sneezing, a mild cough or a fever below 38 degrees Celsius.

• If you have a fever above 38 degrees Celsius or shortness of breath, you and anyone you live with should stay at home. If you feel better and have not had any symptoms for 24 hours, you can go outside again.

Avoid busy places and keep your distance

• Make sure you can always stay 1.5 metres from others.

• If this is impossible, go somewhere else.

Step by step
The government will start by relaxing restrictions at local or neighbourhood level to avoid flooding our streets, traffic and public transport. The government will then relax restrictions at regional level and finally at national level. First small gatherings will be allowed and later larger gatherings, so that everything remains as manageable and orderly as possible. The details will be worked out in the weeks ahead.

From 11 May the following will apply:

Schools

-   Primary schools, including special primary schools, and childcare providers will reopen on 11 May.

Sports and play

-   Young people aged 13 to 18 will be allowed to play sports together outdoors under supervision, but must stay 1.5 metres apart.

-   Adults can play sports outdoors from 11 May as long as they can stay 1.5 metres apart. Matches and competitions are not allowed, and nor is the use of shared changing rooms. Showers may only be taken at home.

Contact-based roles

-   Most people in contact-based roles will be allowed to perform their jobs again. This includes driving instructors, medical and paramedical professionals (dieticians, massage therapists, occupational therapists, prosthodontics, etc.), hair and beauty professionals (hairdressers, beauticians, pedicurists, etc.) and alternative medicine practitioners (acupuncturists, homeopaths, etc.).

-   They should stay 1.5 metres apart from their clients wherever possible.

-   They should see clients by appointment only and assess possible health risks beforehand together with the client.

Libraries

-   Libraries will reopen to the public and take measures to ensure that library users can stay 1.5 metres apart.

Public transport

-   Only use public transport if there is no alternative. Avoid rush hours and keep as far apart as possible.

-    You are advised to wear a non-medical facemask on public transport. From 1 June this will be compulsory.

Facemasks
In some situations it is impossible to stay 1.5 metres apart. It will therefore be compulsory to wear non-medical facemasks on public transport from 1 June. To avoid scarcity, you should not wear facemasks intended for health professionals. People in contact-based roles can eliminate many risks by discussing health issues with clients beforehand. As a result, wearing a facemask will not be necessary during appointments, though everyone is of course free to do so.

Restrictions can only be lifted if the virus remains under control. People must continue to maintain a distance of 1.5 metres from others. Any decision to relax measures can and must be reversed if the circumstances change.

Expected measures from 1 June
If the virus remains under control, the following will be possible:

• secondary schools will reopen (the details still have to be worked out)

• cafés and restaurants may reopen outdoor seating areas as long as people can stay 1.5 metres apart

Cinemas, restaurants, cafés and cultural institutions (such as concert venues and theatres) will reopen, subject to certain conditions:

• a maximum of 30 people (including staff). People must be able to stay 1.5 metres apart

• visitors must reserve beforehand

• the owner will discuss with customers beforehand whether their visit entails risks

• museums and heritage sites will reopen. Visitors must buy tickets beforehand, to ensure people can stay 1.5 metres apart

Since public transport will probably become busier around 1 June, it will be more difficult to stay 1.5 metres apart. That is why everyone travelling on public transport will be required to wear a non-medical facemask.

Expected measures from 15 June
If we keep the virus under control, secondary vocational education (MBO) schools can reopen for exams and practical training. Plans are being drawn up for reopening MBO schools, institutions for higher professional education (HBO) and universities more fully at some point in the future.

Expected measures from 1 July
If we keep the virus under control, shared toilets and shower blocks at campsites and holiday parks can reopen on 1 July. The maximum number of visitors to cinemas, restaurants, cafés and cultural institutions can hopefully be increased to 100. This increase would also apply to the maximum number of participants at organised gatherings, such as church services, weddings, rehearsals and funerals.

Expected measures from 1 September
If the virus remains under control, gyms, saunas, health spas, club canteens, cannabis cafés, casinos and sex establishments will reopen. People of all ages will be allowed to take part in contact sports and indoor sports. Sports events, including professional football matches, can take place without spectators.

A decision regarding mass spectator events such as festivals and major concerts will be taken before 1 September.

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE #7

The Dutch government has announced a further extension of its Coronavirus control measures until at least 20 May 2020. At the same time, the first cautious steps towards reopening the country are taken by reopening primary schools and day-care centres from 11 May and by reintroducing group sports for children and young people.

We know that the ongoing uncertainty – as well as the lack of access to the school building and workshops – is having a serious impact on our students. The extension of the government’s ‘intelligent lockdown’ is necessary, but it takes a toll on all of us. We continue to find ourselves in an unprecedented situation.

It is not always easy to stay focused and be productive in this unique scenario. We greatly appreciate the effort that has been put into finding new ways of working by all of the staff, heads, coordinators and tutors. Without them, we would be facing an insurmountable challenge. 

Even though we are slowly moving in the right direction, it is not the time to become complacent – we must stay at home as much as possible and maintain social distancing to help control the spread of the virus. All events in The Netherlands are now suspended until 1 September and there are still fines for people who do not maintain distancing in public.  Please see below for more details on the new rules and a reminder of the existing regulations.

In the week before 20 May, the government will assess the situation again. Our plans to reopen the school in phases remain unchanged with graduating students able to return in June for exams and all other students returning at the start of the next Academic year (for more information please read the previous update). We are very much looking forward to seeing you all back at the Academy.

Please read our updated Q&A on the DAE website to find the latest information on any relevant changes.

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE #6

As you may be aware, the Dutch government has decided to continue with a targeted lockdown until 28 April 2020. The government’s prohibition on gatherings remains in place until 1 June, capping meetings between 30 and 100 people. The government hopes that this and all other measures taken will help limit the ongoing impact of the Coronavirus COVID-19 and will assess the situation again in the week before 28 April.

Our plan has always been to follow the national guidelines. We must also comply with the ban on gatherings and groups, which has major implications for our open-structured educational floors and workshops.

As a result, we are extending the closure of DAE up to and including 1 June. When we reopen, it will be with access for upcoming graduates only, while keeping in mind the regulations. 

All other students will continue to have access to online education for the remainder of the academic year as previously scheduled and we are looking forward to welcoming you back to the Academy at the beginning of September.

We are aware that this has major consequences. We have read students’ letters and listened to their feedback and hope this update will provide some reassurance. We don’t have all the answers yet, but we have met with the Bachelor Course Committee and will be meeting with the Student Council today. 

We are also continuously working with heads, coordinators and staff to find practical solutions. For most students, education and assessments are already continuing online. A number of working groups have been formed to address how we deliver this for all BA students, and we will be introducing a new online program soon.

The heads of our MA departments have started with adapting their curriculum to remote teaching, and will finalise and refine this in the coming weeks.

We would like to thank you all for your enthusiasm and understanding so far and for helping us discover new ways of working. This includes students (studying online) as well as all education staff (organising programs and online teaching) and organisational staff (working from home).

Very few times in its history – if ever – has the Academy had to deal with a crisis of this magnitude and delicacy, and there is no playbook to follow. There are countless aspects of the school’s organisation that need to be rethought, and we are working as quickly as we can to develop alternatives to our normal practices. 

Our priority now will be reaching out to the constituent groups of our community, especially the student body, to involve you in the difficult decisions that face us as we move forwards and adapt to this new reality. This deeply disorienting situation will severely test our strength in the weeks ahead, but together we will make the right decisions, always giving priority to the safety and health of our own community and the communities around us.

Incremental opening

Our current plan is to reopen the school incrementally from 2 June onwards, prioritising the needs of students who are due to graduate imminently. In practical terms, this means the second year MA students and fourth year BA students will be the only students with access to the workshops and education spaces. We will also extend our opening dates for these students (more on this below). 

Although we would like to welcome everyone back, we will need to continue to control the number of people within the building and avoid creating groups and gatherings to conform to the RIVM guidelines. Among other things, this means that we have to keep a distance of 1.5 metres from each other in the general areas of the Academy and the workshops. DAE employees will supervise compliance with the RIVM guidelines in the building. 

However, the workshops will continue to provide guidance to all students during this period through their Facebook group. 

Summer access

We know that being away from the workshops, from mentors and from each other is challenging. Staff, heads, teachers and coordinators have collectively agreed to keep the school open as much as possible over the summer to give graduating students access to workshops and education spaces. This means we will only close for two weeks, from 27 July to 7 August. 

The opening of the next academic year will take place two days later than planned, on Thursday 3 September.

Exams

The examination committee is developing guidelines for assessments that take into account the major disruption caused by the closure of the Academy. 

We know that many students will be faced with unique challenges during this period and that some students may not be able to return to The Netherlands for some time due to travel restrictions. With this in mind, we are working closely with heads and coordinators to develop an appropriate policy for the final assessments, with a focus on equality and flexibility. 

The schedule is not finalised, but we are currently proposing the following exam dates for BA and MA:

    23 June 2020 for those who can do their exam online 
    24-28 August 2020 for those who need to use the workshops

Re-examinations for those who do not pass will be in the second half of October. This means your work may not be in the Graduation Show publication, but can still be in the show itself. 

Graduation Ceremony

An online Graduation Ceremony will be made available to students as an option. For all other students the Graduation Ceremony will take place on 1 September, with the Masters’ graduations in the morning and the Bachelors’ in the evening. 

The Graduation Show

The annual Graduation Show is an important event for the school and we are looking forward to GS20. 

We have already started work on assembling the creative, editorial and production team for GS20 and everything is on track, but they will need help and support from the graduating students over the summer to make sure it can be delivered on time.  

There are currently no plans to have a purely virtual show. 

Ongoing studies

All of our other education programs will continue online – albeit in a slightly new format, with the well-known quality of DAE. This means that the academic year will continue for current BA students in the first, second and third year and for first year MA students. More focused information will be shared soon about how students will complete their year.

Most students are already receiving online teaching and we will soon be ready to provide similar programs for everyone. Although we cannot replicate the environment of the Academy in the virtual world, we can find collective solutions and support systems to create interesting ideas and we welcome all of your feedback to make this period fruitful.

Tuition fees

The Dutch government has strict regulations regarding tuition fees that we must comply with, like all colleges and universities in The Netherlands. The Executive Board will include this topic in our conversation with the Student Council today.

We are offering students the opportunity to get through this period without a delay to their studies and with the highest quality of teaching that we can provide, including access to heads, tutors and support staff. We want to be as flexible as we can and ensure our students are getting the help that they need. We will keep on working with contact persons. They are able to help you with your questions, including questions regarding financial aspects.

Finally

Closing the Academy has already had a big impact on our whole community, but we know it is the right thing to do in this unprecedented moment. We want you to know that we are here and that planning will continue daily on all levels to overcome the challenges of this period. In the meantime, we send you our strength and best wishes, and can’t wait to get back together again soon at the Academy!

We advise you to follow your online educational programme and to keep an eye on your e-mail and the DAE website. We will update our Q&A for students and staff covering frequently asked questions as soon as we can. 

 

If you are a student and you have any questions, please consult the coordinator of the department or Olga Pullens (Dean) (+31 6 44594717).

If you are a tutor and you have any questions, please consult the coordinator of the department or Emke Molnar (HR) (+31 6 83372689).

If you are staff, head or coordinator and you have any questions, please consult your supervisor or Emke Molnar (HR) (+31 6 83372689).

If Emke or Olga cannot be reached directly by phone, please send them a text message.

 

Measurements by the Dutch Government, 31 March 2020

The Government decided today that all coronary measures in the Netherlands will be extended until Tuesday 28 April. Schools will stay closed at least until after the May holidays. After that, institutions, shops and other places of business will open in phases, as long as there is no further extension. In the week before 28 April, the Government will assess what is needed for the period thereafter. 

The prohibition on gatherings remains in force until 1 June. 

The Netherlands is still a long way off beating the Coronavirus. However, the right path has been taken. The number of sick people is still increasing, but not as fast as a few weeks ago, before measures were announced. 

1. Events with a licensing and reporting requirement will be prohibited until 1 June 2020.

All other meetings will be prohibited, with a few exceptions:

a. Statutory meetings (maximum 100 persons), such as meetings of the Municipal Council and the States General;
b. Meetings necessary for the continuation of the daily work of institutions, companies and other organisations (up to 100 persons);
c. funerals and weddings (max 30 persons);
d. Meetings of a religious or philosophical nature (up to 30 people).

These gatherings may only take place if all hygiene measures to combat the Coronavirus are observed and if it is possible to keep a distance of 1.5 metres from each other.

2. Casinos, amusement arcades and similar establishments will be closed.

3. The exercise of all forms of contact professions is prohibited, as long as it is not possible to keep a distance of 1.5 metres from the customer. This includes masseurs, hairdressers, nail stylists, escort services and driving instructors. An exception is made for the treatment of (para)medical professions, provided there is an individual medical indication for this and the practitioner can comply with all hygiene requirements.

4. If the hygiene measures in force and the 1.5 metre distance are not or not sufficiently observed, shops and markets must be closed and public transport must be terminated.

5. Locations such as holiday parks, camping sites, parks, nature reserves and beaches shall be closed if the applicable hygiene measures and the 1.5 metre distance are not or not sufficiently observed at these locations or if there is a risk of this happening.

6. Group formation (accidental or otherwise) in public spaces is prohibited. The Cabinet defines a group as three or more persons who do not keep a distance of 1.5 metres. There is no question of group formation if it concerns persons who form a joint household. There is also no question of group formation if children up to and including 12 years of age play together under the supervision of one or more parents or guardians. Provided that the parents and/or guardians keep a distance of 1.5 metres between them.

The letter to the Safety Council states that measures 2 and 3 must be included in an emergency ordinance. Measures 4 to 7 must be included in the emergency ordinance in such a way that enforcement becomes possible if necessary.

Measures 2 to 6 will be extended until Tuesday 28 April.

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE #5

Thank you all for your patience and support while our staff have been adapting to the new normal of working from home over the past week.

Following government requests earlier this month, we felt that closing the Academy until 6 April 2020 was the best decision to help limit the impact of the novel Coronavirus COVID-19 and keep our community safe.

On 23 March, the Dutch government announced it was introducing stricter measures to control the spread of the coronavirus, banning various forms of gathering. Since then, it has clarified new rules for gatherings and events (see below for more information). However, there has not been a clear update from the government about what this means for schools, colleges and universities.

Our plan is to follow the national guidelines for education, which we expect to be updated on 31 March. Several schools in The Netherlands have already decided to remain closed until 1 June and we believe it’s likely that this will be the new date issued by the government. We don’t know if the rules will be relaxed during this extended period.

We know this is particularly unsettling for graduates and students who are coming to the end of their studies, for whom this should be a busy and focused few months. DAE’s staff, coordinators, heads and tutors have been working together to find solutions to the delay to exams and we hope to be able to offer more clarity soon.

The Executive Board is monitoring the situation closely and we will update you on Tuesday 31 March. The Executive Board will share more detailed information about future education and the final exams.

Contact the workshops
In the meantime, our workshop staff would like all students to know that they can be contacted on their new Facebook page. They are available for all your questions.

More information
If you have questions that are not covered by this update or want to know who to contact for more information, please see our Q&A on the DAE website. We will keep this updated as the situation evolves. Please also read the new rules for meetings and events below.

All of our previous updates remain available to read on our website. Please make sure you have read Update #2, which outlines our responsibility as a school and symptoms to look out for if you are unwell.

 

 

The new rules for meetings and events

1. Events with a licensing and reporting requirement will be prohibited until 1 June 2020.

All other meetings will be prohibited, with a few exceptions:

a. Statutory meetings (maximum 100 persons), such as meetings of the Municipal Council and the States General;
b. Meetings necessary for the continuation of the daily work of institutions, companies and other organisations (up to 100 persons);
c. funerals and weddings (max 30 persons);
d. Meetings of a religious or philosophical nature (up to 30 people).

These gatherings may only take place if all hygiene measures to combat the Coronavirus are observed and if it is possible to keep a distance of 1.5 metres from each other.

2. Casinos, amusement arcades and similar establishments will be closed.

3. The exercise of all forms of contact professions is prohibited, as long as it is not possible to keep a distance of 1.5 metres from the customer. This includes masseurs, hairdressers, nail stylists, escort services and driving instructors. An exception is made for the treatment of (para)medical professions, provided there is an individual medical indication for this and the practitioner can comply with all hygiene requirements.

4. If the hygiene measures in force and the 1.5 metre distance are not or not sufficiently observed, shops and markets must be closed and public transport must be terminated.

5. Locations such as holiday parks, camping sites, parks, nature reserves and beaches shall be closed if the applicable hygiene measures and the 1.5 metre distance are not or not sufficiently observed at these locations or if there is a risk of this happening.

6. Group formation (accidental or otherwise) in public spaces is prohibited. The Cabinet defines a group as three or more persons who do not keep a distance of 1.5 metres. There is no question of group formation if it concerns persons who form a joint household. There is also no question of group formation if children up to and including 12 years of age play together under the supervision of one or more parents or guardians. Provided that the parents and/or guardians keep a distance of 1.5 metres between them.

The letter to the Safety Council states that measures 2 and 3 must be included in an emergency ordinance. Measures 4 to 7 must be included in the emergency ordinance in such a way that enforcement becomes possible if necessary.

Measures 2 to 6 will be reconsidered no later than 6 April 2020.

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE #4

Thank you to all of you for your understanding, flexibility and ingenuity over the past week, following our decision to close the Academy until 06 April 2020 as part of the wider social strategy to mitigate the spread of the Coronavirus COVID-19.

We have updated our Q&A for staff and students covering frequently asked questions, including the continuation of studies, international travel and what to do with your library books. Below you can find the most recent updates considering COVID-19 and DAE.

Travel update
The heads of the EU decided on 17 March 2020 to close the EU external border to most non-EU residents. Some individual countries, such as France, Poland and the Czech Republic, have also closed their borders to citizens from other EU countries. The borders with Belgium and Germany remain open for the time being.

It is still possible for most people to travel to their home country if they wish to. We advise you to contact your embassy if you have any concerns. You can find a list of international embassies in The Netherlands here.

Wherever you are, we expect you to be available online to continue your education. 

Lectures cancelled
All DAE lectures are postponed or cancelled while the academy is closed. This includes the lecture by Intellectual Property (IP) attorney Gregor Vos of Brinkhof Lawyers that was due to take place on 24 March 2020, which will be rescheduled once DAE reopens. We are investigating online alternatives for other scheduled talks.

Master’s departments
The master’s departments would like to extend a special thank you to all of their students for embracing the challenge and continuing their projects for the second trimester as well as providing tutors with images and videos to allow their work to be evaluated during Finals, which took place this week. They have shown resilience and creativity in this difficult moment.

This coming Monday, the MA programs will continue as planned with the start of the third trimester. The departments have been working on adapting their assignments and teaching strategies to the situation. There is no doubt that students, tutors, coordinators and heads will develop new ways of working and new skills in the coming weeks.

Bachelor’s applications for the new academic year 2020-2021
Our BA application rounds took place as planned in the two weeks before DAE closed. Thankfully, they were very successful. Approximately 350 students from all over the world have already been interviewed via Skype and we still have more interviews planned for the coming week. We have been privileged to talk to inspiring candidates with great portfolios, who are full of enthusiasm and have shown us a part of their world. Thank you to all of the admissions teams for their hard work in these unusual circumstances.

DAE building closed
The entire DAE building is now closed. All the administrative and organisational work that keeps the Academy running is being done remotely by staff working from home. We are following the government's advice to stay at home as much as possible. Meetings are still being planned and taking place via Skype and other platforms. To date, there have been no reports of COVID-19 infections within DAE.

Appeal for solidarity
There is a lot of pressure on our care, welfare and education sectors in The Netherlands and internationally. At DAE, many of our heads, coordinators, teachers and staff are going above and beyond the call of duty to make sure that we can continue to provide an education to our students in difficult circumstances. Providing childcare at home during working hours and looking after sick relatives makes this even more challenging. 

Some people are able to do less than they usually would, and others are being asked to do more. We ask everyone to be understanding and show solidarity during this period. We will eventually be able to return to work at the Academy and we will need a united and committed team to help us get back to normal. 

The Academy is currently building an internal system to help us keep track of supply and demand and take into account employees who are juggling extra jobs or who have capacity to help more.

Email phishing/virus warning
There is an email circulating at the moment with the subject line: "Warning! CORONAVIRUS. Presentation VBS COVID-19. This email contains a .RAR file that it claims contains important information. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS. The RAR file is malware/ransomware. Report the email to your email provider if you can. Please stay alert during these turbulent times and when in doubt, don't open a suspicious attachment or website link.

Reporting obligation reminder
In the case of a possible contamination, there is a reporting obligation. DAE is required to report to the GGD. Therefore, your cooperation and information is crucial to DAE. During the closed period you can also reach out to Olga Pullens (Dean) – (+31 6 44594717).   

Further questions
If you are a student and you have any questions, please consult the coordinator of your department or Olga Pullens (Dean) (+31 6 44594717).

If you are a tutor and you have any questions, please consult the coordinator of the department or Emke Molnar (HR) (+31 6 83372689).

If you are staff, head or coordinator and you have any questions, please consult your supervisor or Emke Molnar (HR) (+31 6 83372689).

If Emke or Olga cannot be reached directly by phone, please send them a text message.

Finally
As of 15 March 2020, the Dutch Government has called on Universities of Applied Sciences to suspend offering on-site education up to and including 06 April 2020. This is part of its strategy to control the spread of the novel Coronavirus Covid-19. We believe the right decision is to close the academy and postpone all on-site teaching up to 06 April 2020. 

Please make sure you have read our previous update #2, as it explains many things about our responsibility as a school, hygiene measures and more info on how to check if you are infected.

---

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE #3

The Dutch Government notes that universities and colleges of applied sciences often have a diverse, international population. This means that these institutes also deal with many entry and exit movements. They therefore call on these institutes, and thus on our institute, to no longer offer education on location until March 31.

At Design Academy Eindhoven we noticed that the number of students coming to school was gradually dwindling. Up until this point, tutors were present and until March 11 education has continued as normal. But the consideration of the government's measure for cultural institutions, public places and events involving gatherings of more than 100 people also applies within our open structured educational floors and workshops. DAE's applied educational programme includes various craft workshops, and working side by side with fellow students and tutors. These activities cannot easily be replaced by online lectures and online tutoring. However, due to the individual character of guidance within the MA programmes, the education and assessments of Master students can continue online. Online education to continue the BA curriculum will be developed in the upcoming week.

Our paramount concern is the student’s and staff’s health and wellbeing. Therefore, and from a collective societal point of view, we want to contribute to minimize risk for our surrounding communities and take into account that there is a group within society that is not strengthened against the virus. Until today no infections have been reported in the academy and these measures will contribute that it will stay like that.

For that reason we close DAE as from Friday March 13 until March 31. The academy remains open today, Friday 13 March, until 17:00 so students are able to collect their personal belongings.

Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE) is currently home to a community of many nationalities and cultures from more than 50 different countries worldwide. Most of our staff lives in the Netherlands, but some of them also live outside of the Netherlands. And apart from the nationality of our student body and staff a considerable amount of them also work internationally. Now that the coronavirus is confirmed as a pandemic we safeguard our international character and take our responsibility towards public health at the forefront of everything we do.

We are working with the heads and coordinators of each department to develop an appropriate, supportive policy for upcoming end-of-term and final assessments and for the ongoing syllabus. The details will be worked out over the next week and we will update all students when the school reopens or within the next two weeks. DAE’s executive board asks for your understanding in this exceptional situation.

 

With kinds regards,

DAE Executive Board

 

 

Below you will find the new measures for the whole population of the Netherlands

 

Please also read the rest of the updates protocol with a new set of measures by Dutch Government announced this afternoon. All measures below will be in effect as of today and will run until March 31 (until further notice):

Firstly, the measures for our province Brabant are stricter than in any other province due to the high amount of untraceable infections.

1.     Reporting obligation

In the case of a possible contamination, there is a reporting obligation. DAE is required to report to the GGD. Therefore, your cooperation and information is crucial to DAE. Also during the closed period you can reach out to Olga Pullens (Dean) (+31 6 44594717).

2.     Stay at home when ill

If it is in any way possible to work from home instead of public spaces, even if you are healthy, please do so. It is better to avoid any risk of spreading the infection.

In the event of any health complaints, such as a cold, cough, or fever stay at home until you have had contact with doctors or the municipal health service GGD. Be precautious and take an incubation period of two weeks into account. Please read our previous protocol #2 for more info on how to check if you are infected.

This advice was already in place in the previous protocol, but we stress that it is important to follow up on this advice. This advice is regardless of where you have been and with whom you have been in contact.

3.     Events with more than 100 visitors are cancelled

Any event that attracts more than 100 people are forbidden. This will affect museums, sport matches, lectures and so on. This already has been the reason why all large gatherings at DAE did not take place.

4.     Avoid public transport

Before you travel at any time this upcoming period, please consider carefully if it is necessary to do so. It is adviced to avoid public transport if you are one of the risk-groups. Although our community is young and vital, in order to keep it that way please consider your travels as these public spaces are areas were infection can take place.

Also consider your travels abroad, restrictions change quickly as we have seen with the ban by the us and that might mean it could disrupt or prevent your travel to other countries and more importantly, your return to Eindhoven. We also like to refer to update #2 concerning this matter.

5.     Please consider visiting elderly or vulnerable people

Dutch Government calls to action towards awareness: Although you might not feel very ill or you might think you are not infected, the illness can be transmitted to people who are in much bigger danger than you might be and could be facing serious implications from COVID-19.

6.     Finally

Please read our previous update #2 with care as it explains many things about our responsibility as a school and hygiene measures. Lastly, we know that the measures might change by the hour. We will update you once needed. The national protocol of the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) is the guideline upon which we act.

If you are a student and you have any questions, please consult the coordinator of the department or Olga Pullens (Dean) (+31 6 44594717).

If you are a tutor and you have any questions, please consult the coordinator of the department or Emke Molnar (HR) (+31 6 83372689).

If you are staff, head or coordinator and you have any questions, please consult your supervisor or Emke Molnar (HR) (+31 6 83372689).

If Emke or Olga cannot be reached directly by phone, please send them a text message.

# DAE COVID-19 UPDATE #2

The last few days the Corona virus (COVID-19) has spread over various countries in Europe including the Netherlands. We like to firstly state that there are currently no grounds to close DAE* This brief is to inform you what measures we are taking and what you should do when there is a potential infection with the new Corona virus.

1.Work from home if necessary
 

We advice anyone with respiratory complaints, coughing, shortness of breath or fever to stay at home as a precaution – regardless of where you have been and with whom you have been in contact. We consider this measure necessary due to our open and international character, combined with the high probability of a person infected in The Netherlands with the new coronavirus. In case of intensive contact with an infected relationship, we advise you to stay at home for 2 weeks.

This way we will do everything we can to prevent a large part of DAE from being sick at the same time…. ‘Better safe than sorry', right?

If you are a student and you have any questions, please consult the coordinator of the department or Olga Pullens (Dean) (+31 6 44594717).

If you are a tutor and you have any questions, please consult the coordinator of the department or Emke Molnar (HR) (+31 6 83372689).

If you are staff, head or coordinator and you have any questions, please consult your supervisor or Emke Molnar (HR) (+31 6 83372689).

If Emke or Olga cannot be reached directly by phone, please send them a text message about the Corona virus.

2.International Travel

Before you travel at any time this upcoming period, please consider carefully the evolving situation in countries outside The Netherlands. Restrictions change quickly and that might mean it could disrupt or prevent your travel to other countries and more importantly, your return to Eindhoven. 

Although you currently may travel freely to most countries, a sudden change in travel policy during your trip could prevent you from returning to NL and thus the successful completion of the rest of your academic year.

Also, in case you or your department planned an excursion linked to your studies, please consider the possibility of the trip to be cancelled on short notice, with the potential of losing any investments done beforehand. If you do not feel comfortable taking a risk, you are free to follow your own critical judgement whether you want to join or not.

We are particularly concerned for international students who may encounter greater difficulty returning to The Netherlands, the EU mainland or Europe, if additional restrictions are imposed.

We follow the travel advice of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs so please keep a close eye on these they change frequently. You can find them here: https://www.nederlandwereldwijd.nl/reizen/reisadviezen.

In addition, it is important that travellers adhere to the travel protocol of the country from which they depart.

Example of a risk analysis for incoming student, teacher or staff member from "yellow" area:

-What is the situation in the area you come from?

-Was quarantine warranted in the area?

-Did you have contact with people who are infected?

-How were things in the immediate vicinity? Parents, family?

-Did you use public transportation frequently?


If the risk is estimated to be low and the traveller may leave the country, then travel is also permitted. This is in line with the national policy of RIVM and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 

3.Possible infection
 

In the event of a possible infection, do not come to DAE and stay at home until you have had contact with doctors or the municipal health service GGD. Be precautious and take an incubation period of two weeks into account. Please be aware that preventive testing of persons from an infected area does not provide any certainty. If someone is infected with the virus, it can only be tested once someone has complaints.
 

What are the symptoms?:

1.Fever (at least 38 degrees Celsius) and at least one of the following respiratory symptoms: cough, shortness of breath
