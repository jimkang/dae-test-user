# GENERAL QUESTIONS

---

## How do I enter the Academy?

You can enter through the student entrance on the first floor. Movement between the floors is via the staircases only. There is a one-way system in place – for all staircases- one stairwell is dedicated to going up and one to going down. This can be confusing, so please look carefully at the directions on the doors before you use the stairs. The elevator is only to be used for goods by one person at a time. Disinfection stations for workspaces and workshops are located around the building. Disinfection wipes are also available.

---

## When can I enter the Academy?
DAE supports and acknowledges the current curfew restrictions. As a result, we have changed the opening hours of the Academy building to allow all community members to reach their homes before the curfew begins in the evening. The current hours are:

 - Monday to Thursday 8:00 - 18:00
 - Friday 8:00 - 17:30
 - Pre-scheduled Saturdays 09:00 to 16:30

We do not facilitate Employer Declarations for curfew exemptions.
Students are currently allowed to access the workshops and workspaces according to a schedule draw up by the BA and MA coordinators and through the workshops booking app. More information on this can be found in the Information for [Students page](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/covid-19-qanda/information-for-students) of the Covid section on the DAE website.

---

## What is DAE basing its decision-making on regarding Covid-19?

The Dutch Government and the [national protocol](http://www.rivm.nl/en/current-information-about-novel-coronavirus-covid-19)  of the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM).

---

## How is DAE managing the evolving policies around COVID-19?

We support working from home for staff and students if and when possible. There is also a constant dialogue between the Executive Board with the Bachelor Course Committee, Master Courses and the Student Council on this as well. We are trying to keep students and staff as informed as possible, with regular updates sent via email and posted on our website.

---

## What rules do I need to follow within the Academy?

The main rules for everyone inside the Academy building are:

 - Wear a mask when moving around the Academy
 - Maintain a 1.5-metre distance from other people at all times when inside the building
 - Use the entrance on the first floor and register your arrival
 - Follow the one-way system on the staircases
 - Respect the booking systems and schedules for the workshops and workspaces 
 
Mask-wearing is compulsory while moving around, but wearing a mask while seated is a personal decision. This is in line with the measures put in place by the government. Under no circumstances is it appropriate for tutors, staff or students to ask anyone within the community to remove a mask while in the building, even if it is hard to understand what someone is saying.

If you notice that a workspace is becoming too busy to maintain the distancing rule, you should notify the course coordinator and leave the space.

## What is DAE’s response to the recent Covid-19 protests in Eindhoven (January 2021)?

On 25 January, DAE's Executive Board was forced to close the school early in response to warnings about further action.  

DAE believes strongly in the right to protest peacefully, which is a fundamental human right that must be protected. It does not condone violence or destructive behaviour. 

Read the full statement, including information on increased security at the Academy building, [here](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/news/covid-19-protests-in-eindhoven).

---

## Where can I find the latest COVID-19 updates from DAE?

You can find them all on this website, which has a dedicated section for all of our communications and guidance on [COVID-19](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/covid-19-qanda). We publish new announcements as we implement each new measure from the RIVM and the Ministry of Education. Previous announcements are also available in our archive. 

## When do I need to quarantine?
 
With more people likely to be using the building, it is important to know that there is a strict quarantine policy in place. 

In the case of a confirmed COVID-19 infection within the DAE community, all staff and students who have been in close contact with the individual must go into quarantine for a minimum of five days. After the first five days, they can be tested for the virus, but this is voluntary. If they choose not to be tested, they must remain in quarantine for a further five days. 

DAE will provide remote education to any affected students during the quarantine period wherever possible.

## How do I get tested for Covid-19?

Anyone who has any of the known symptoms of the virus can request a free test via the [government’s booking system](https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-test).


## How many students and staff does DAE have?

DAE has 729 students (75% bachelors, 25% masters) and almost 250 employees (75 fte), including many freelancers in education and support staff. More than 40 different countries are represented within our community. Most of our staff lives in The Netherlands, but some travel in from other countries. Many of our faculty, students and staff also work internationally.

---

## Who are the surrounding communities that we are concerned for?

We are proud to be part of the city of Eindhoven and feel a strong responsibility to its inhabitants – particularly those who are more vulnerable to the virus, including those suffering from pre-existing conditions.

Information about (self-)quarantine and other rules from the [Dutch Government](https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19)

## Am I affected by a travel ban or Covid-19 testing restrictions if entering or leaving the Netherlands?

The government has asked everyone in the Netherlands not to travel and book no new trips until after 15 April. It has advised individuals considering travelling to the Netherlands to defer their plans unless their trip is strictly necessary.

Anyone arriving in the Netherlands for any reason and from any location must go into quarantine. After the first five days of quarantine, they can be tested for Covid-19 and, if the result is negative, they will no longer be required to isolate.

The EU member states have placed severe restrictions on travel to the EU Schengen area, which includes the Netherlands. This means that people from outside of the EU without proof of permission to enter the country can be turned back. There are a small number of exemptions to this rule, including people who are travelling from designated safe countries such as Australia, South Korea and China. 

From 16 March, the following groups will be reintroduced to the list of exceptions and will be able to enter the Netherlands: business travellers, students and professionals from the cultural and creative sectors. 

More information on the entry ban is available on the Dutch government’s website: <https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/visiting-the-netherlands-from-abroad/exemptions-to-the-entry-ban>

The current list of safe countries can be found here: <https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/visiting-the-netherlands-from-abroad/eu-list-of-safe-countries>

 The flight ban on entries from the UK was lifted on 9 March. However, a flight ban is still in place for arrivals from the following countries: South Africa, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, Venezuela.

From 16 March, anyone travelling to the Netherlands from a “high-risk” area must be able to show a negative result from a PCR test taken no more than 24 hours before arriving in the Netherlands OR a rapid test result. 

Anyone arriving or passing through the Netherlands to take a connecting flight will need to show a negative result from a PCR test based on a sample no more than 72-hours old. Rapid tests will no longer be required in this instance.

Anyone travelling to the Netherlands from a “high-risk” area is required to take a rapid Covid-19 test no more than four hours before they travel. This must have a clear negative result. This is in addition to the existing regulation requiring a negative result from a PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arriving in the Netherlands.

---

## Can I take an indirect flight to The Netherlands?

See above and Non-EU students are advised to travel to The Netherlands on a direct flight wherever possible. If you do have to make a stopover, you must check in advance whether the stopover country allows this. Read the latest advice from the Dutch Government [here](https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19).

---

## What kind of documents do non-EU students need when travelling?
 
All students must have a health certificate with them, which declares that they have tested negative within the permitted time period. 

Current students with a residence permit must bring their valid residence document in addition to the health certificate.  New students entering with a visa must already be in possession of the visa (a sticker in the passport). They can therefore only travel after they have been to their local embassy to arrange this. They can make an appointment with the embassy as soon as they have received an acceptance letter from DAE.

New students who do not need an entry visa must take the IND’s decision (authorisation) with them when they are going to travel. They will receive this from DAE.
