# INFORMATION FOR STUDENTS

---

## What is happening to my course?

All courses are continuing. From 15 February 2021, DAE moved towards a hybrid form of education, blending online teaching and on-site practical work. This will remain in place until the summer, assuming that the government does not tighten the Covid-19 regulations any further. 

All lessons will be available online, so students who do not feel safe or who are unable to travel can still attend. For those entering the building, different access scenarios for different student groups have been shared by the educational desk and coordinators. 

## How do I enter the Academy building?

Students entering the building must check-in at the desk at the student entrance. Access will be granted based on the presentation of a student card, so don’t forget to bring it with you if you are using the building. 

We’re committed to giving students access to DAE’s facilities in a safe and responsible manner. This is why access is regulated for departments and classes on a daily basis. 

However, MA and BA graduating students preparing for their finals can access the building without restrictions. 
Access to the workshops and library is only possible by booking through the app that has been shared with all current students.

The access schedule has been communicated via the educational desk and coordinators and is outlined below, but please contact your coordinator if you aren’t sure when you can enter the building.

DAE is currently open on a limited number of Saturdays to host the Foundation Year programme. BA and MA students can access the building on these days ONLY if they have been allowed to enter the building that week according to the schedule. They can use both the workspaces and the two workshops that will be open. The MA floor can be used as normal. Access to other spaces is on a first-come-first-served basis and strictly limited due to the number of Foundation Year students. 

Current access schedule MA:
All students preparing for final exams and graduation have full access to the building during the final trimester.

## What does the Coronavirus mean for my internship or exchange programme?

If the institution or workplace is in agreement then an internship or exchange can still take place. Students must follow the rules of the place they will be working/studying. Otherwise, please talk to your coordinator to discuss your options.

## Are the workshops open?

Due to the curfew currently in effect within the Netherlands, the building is closing earlier than usual. From Monday to Thursday, the workshops close at 18:00 and the building will close completely at 18:30. Closure on Friday remains as usual. This should give students and staff enough time to get home before 21:00.

The curfew is expected to be in place until until 04.30 on Wednesday 31 March.

Reservations for time in the workshops and library can only be made via the [DAE Workshops App](https://apps.powerapps.com/play/d6fc9223-989b-40aa-a8ab-f23bbc666891?tenantId=2c1cfd24-625c-489e-b1fc-8f745830ea67), [Library app](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.powerapps.com%2Fplay%2F3ffc5c9f-3291-4919-8d74-8dc54ca74b1b%3FtenantId%3D2c1cfd24-625c-489e-b1fc-8f745830ea67&data=02%7C01%7C%7C18e414c00bce408bbfa908d8435f5464%7Cafca0a52882c4fa8b71df6db2e36058b%7C0%7C0%7C637333424015146637&sdata=btOPAULOk30BJE5CYTvaGTo4CrxXxrKxFe%2F8vhW3BlE%3D&reserved=0) or through the Power App in the Apple Store or Google Play Store. You must have your student card with you to be able to check-in for your reserved time slot.

If students have any questions for the workshops concerning tools or materials, you can contact them via email using the details on the DAE website: <https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/workshops>.

Access to the workshops on pre-scheduled Saturdays is only on a first-come-first-served basis for BA and MA students. Only two workshops will be open on Saturdays, depending on the needs of the Foundation Year programme. The schedule will be published soon. Maximum workshop occupancy varies to ensure that there is enough space for the Foundation Year students. 


## Can I travel home or come back to DAE?

We advise you to contact your embassy if you have any concerns. You can find a list of international embassies in The Netherlands [here](https://www.government.nl/topics/embassies-consulates-and-other-representations/overview-countries-and-regions).
Please check the latest updates on the measurements taken in your home country before making a decision. We are following the travel advice from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, so please keep a close eye on these as they change frequently. You can find them [here](https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands/travel-and-holidays/visiting-the-netherlands).

For more information on current travel restrictions and requirements, see our general [Covid-19 Q&A](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/covid-19-qanda/general-questions).


## What do I do if I am in a country with a Coronavirus outbreak and I am not allowed to leave?

Please contact your embassy. If you are in your country of origin and there are contaminations there, please follow local advice.

## What happens to my residence permit if I want to interrupt my studies at DAE?

Students who leave The Netherlands and interrupt their studies have to unroll as a student at DAE. Please send an email to <olga.pullens@designacademy.nl> for more information.
DAE will inform the IND that you have left because of the Corona crisis. You also have to deregister from the municipality where you live. For Eindhoven you can do this through the  website.  The IND will decide whether you have to apply for a new residence permit when you start your studies again in September. They will decide this on a case-by-case basis. Should your residence permit be withdrawn you have to apply for a new permit.

## I am organising/going on a study or business trip to a country with current Coronavirus cases. Is that still allowed?

No, it is not allowed.

## I am a Dutch citizen and would like to travel abroad. Is this allowed?

The government has asked everyone in the Netherlands not to travel and book no new trips until after 15 April.

Please check the travel advice from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This changes frequently. You can find the latest version [here](https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands/travel-and-holidays/visiting-the-netherlands).

## Is there a change in paying tuition fees this year?

The tuition fees for 2020-2021 are set and published on this website. 
→ [Masters tuition fee](https://www.designacademy.nl/study/master/practical-information/tuition-fee)
→ [Bachelor tuition fee](https://www.designacademy.nl/study/bachelor/practical-information/tuition-fee)

There are no changes regarding the payment methods for your tuition fees. The Dutch Government has strict rules and regulations that are mandatory for all institutes. Should there be any future developments regarding higher education tuition fees on a nationwide level, we will update all DAE students.

## Am I eligible for financial compensation for tuition fees?

In the first quarter of 2021, anyone who obtains a higher professional education (BA or MA) in the period from 1 September 2020 until 31 January 2021 will receive a one-off compensation amount, amounting to a maximum of 3 months’ percentage of the tuition fees. For a student in higher education, this would amount to a one-off compensation of €535. This also applies to (international) students who pay institutional tuition fees. They will receive a one-off compensation of €535.

## What must I do to receive this financial compensation for my tuition fees?

If your details are known to DUO (the Dutch education service), you do not have to do anything and DUO will automatically transfer the amount to you. If any of your details are missing, DUO will contact you to request these details. You will receive the amount no later than 31 March 2021. But please keep in mind that the final decision regarding compensation lies with DUO.

## What happens to my scholarship?

For questions about a scholarship you received from your own country, please contact the granting organisation directly.

## What do I do if I have no doctor in The Netherlands?

If you are unfamiliar with the Dutch healthcare system, we would like to draw your attention to healthcare insurance, they can be able to help you. It can be difficult to find a GP due to Covid-19. If you need help, contact <olga.pullens@designacademy.nl> 

## Can I change anything about my Dutch health insurance?

For questions about the insurance of AON we refer you to their website. Ending or interrupting your insurance can be done online. You can find more general information on health insurance [here](https://www.zorgverzekeringslijn.nl/english/)

## What happens to my study finance from DUO?

DUO has arranged several financial options for students who are entitled to studiefinanciering. This applies to Dutch students, but also to EER-students who are entitled to studiefinanciering on the basis of their employment in The Netherlands. You can read more about it here:
→ [DUO measures](https://www.duo.nl/particulier/measures-coronavirus.jsp) 
→ [DUO Q&A on Covid-19](https://www.duo.nl/particulier/corona-vragen-en-antwoorden.jsp)

## Are there options to apply for extra financial support from DUO during this crisis?

For students who are not served by the generic financial options, DUO has offered to make case-by-case exceptions. Please contact DUO to find out if this applies to you.  

Some EER-students cannot work enough hours because of the various restrictions and shutdowns necessitated by the Coronavirus, but have worked enough hours in previous months. For these students DUO has arranged an exception: with a letter from your employer you might still be able to qualify for studiefinanciering. Find out more on the [DUO website](https://www.duo.nl/particulier/footer-engels/contact/index.jsp). 

EER students, who do not work and, therefore, are not entitled to studiefinanciering can apply for a tuition fees loan from DUO. You can apply for this retroactively from 1 September, 2019. The amount from September to March will be paid in one payment, the remainder you will receive in monthly payments. Find out more on the [DUO website](https://www.duo.nl/particulier/student-finance/tuition-fee-loan.jsp).

## What if I am from outside EER and cannot apply to DUO?

Students from countries outside the EER have been made to prove they have enough funds to study at DAE at the time of their visa application in 2019. This was one of the prerequisites for obtaining a residence permit. We expect your means will be covering your expenses in the current situation.

## Where can I find extra information to apply for financial aid?

Information regarding your rights as an employee from the students union [LSVB](https://nietmijnschuld.nl/en-US/corona). 
Information on unemployment benefit from:  [UWV](https://www.uwv.nl/particulieren/languages/english/unemployment-benefit/index.aspx) and   [werk.nl](https://www.werk.nl/werkzoekenden/uitkering-aanvragen/).

Information on the temporary emergency measure bridging employment (NOW) 
NOW is intended to accommodate employers dealing with lost sales. This allows employers to pay their employees on a permanent and flexible contract. Find out more on the [UWV site](https://www.uwv.nl/werkgevers/actueel/now.aspx).

If you are still experiencing considerable financial difficulties and you want someone to review the available options with you, please contact the Student Counsellor <olga.pullens@designacademy.nl>.

Where can I find the latest rules about quarantine, travel and general legal and advisory measures?
The latest information is published on [the Dutch Government’s website](https://www.netherlandsworldwide.nl/documents/publications/2020/04/05/letter-self-quarantine-and-other-coronavirus-measures).
