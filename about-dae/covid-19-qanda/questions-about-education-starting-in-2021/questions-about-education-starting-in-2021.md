# QUESTION ABOUT EDUCATION STARTING 2021

All of DAE’s BA and MA courses are continuing in 2021, as well as the Foundation Year. 

DAE is currently working towards a hybrid form of education, blending online learning and on-site practical work.

This blended approach will remain in place until the summer, assuming that the government does not tighten the Covid-19 regulations any further. 

Different access and online teaching scenarios for different student groups have been shared with the student body by the educational desk. 

Due to the current lockdown, most staff and students are working from home for the majority of the current teaching hours. Opening hours have also been altered in response to the curfew in place in the Netherlands, with early closure of the building at 18:30 from Monday to Thursday.

---

## What are the main changes to facilitate on-site education?

 - The layout of the floors has been altered, and all spaces normally used for exhibitions, lectures and assessments will now be mainly used for education. This is an additional total of 3,500 m2 (WitteDame Hall, MU Space, and second half of 3rd floor).
 - The support staff area has moved to the second floor, which is also more accessible to students.
 - In response to current Covid protocols, we have introduced a number of measures, including a strict schedule for access to the building and a booking system for the workshops. 

The school was transformed in September 2020 with the goal of keeping the Academy open and offering on-site practical education as much as possible according to the Government regulations. DAE has now moved towards a hybrid form of education, blending online teaching and on-site practical work. 

## What measures will the school take to protect everyone's health?

There are strict rules in place for anyone using the building. These include:
 - Maintaining a 1.5-metre distance from anyone else inside the Academy
 - Wearing a mask while moving around the Academy
 - Using the check in system at the student entrance
 - Respecting the access schedule and booking systems
 - Following the one way system on the staircases

These rules are designed to keep the Academy open and keep students, tutors and staff safe. Anyone who does not feel well is told to stay at home in all circumstances. 

Movement between the floors is via the staircases only, which have a one-way system – one set for going up and one set for going down. This can be confusing, but there are directions on the doors at every level. The elevator can only be used for goods, and can only be used by one person.

Disinfection stations are available for workspaces and workshops. These are located at different points in the building. Disinfection wipes are also available.

It is important to take into account that we are controlling access to the building, use of workshops and the library with strict time slots. Time slots can be booked in the apps for the workshops and library. 

The Digital Workshop is using a keycode system instead of pre-booked slots. If there are no codes left, students will have to wait for one to be returned. For more information, see update #12


## How can I book a library visit?

Please use the [DAE Library App](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.powerapps.com%2Fplay%2F3ffc5c9f-3291-4919-8d74-8dc54ca74b1b%3FtenantId%3D2c1cfd24-625c-489e-b1fc-8f745830ea67&data=02%7C01%7C%7C18e414c00bce408bbfa908d8435f5464%7Cafca0a52882c4fa8b71df6db2e36058b%7C0%7C0%7C637333424015146637&sdata=btOPAULOk30BJE5CYTvaGTo4CrxXxrKxFe%2F8vhW3BlE%3D&reserved=0) to book a time slot for visiting the library. You are welcome in the Entrance zone of the library without a reservation. Use the info button within the App for more detailed information. Books can also be handed over at the Student Entrance. 

Students should cancel their booking if their plans change to ensure that slots are not wasted.

Library opening times: 
Monday 12.30 - 16.30 
Tuesday 8.00 - 12.00 and 12.30 - 16.30 
Wednesday 8.00 - 12.00 
Thursday 9.30 - 12.00 and 12.30 - 18.00 
Friday 8.00 - 12.00 and 12.30 - 16.30 

## Can I browse the library catalogue online?

Yes, you can, just click on the following link to do so: [library.designacademy.nl](https://library.designacademy.nl)


## Can I be somewhat flexible with the starting time of each day?

No, students and staff alike need to come to DAE within their given time slot. Only then can we safeguard everybody’s wellbeing within our building.


## What do I do when I feel unwell?

Stay at home. If your complaints seem corona related (cold, fever, throat ache etc) please make sure you go for a test. You can make an appointment via phone on 0800-1202 or go to coronatest.nl (make sure you have your DIGID at hand). Please check the COVID communication chart who to contact within DAE. If your test is negative and you are without symptoms for at least 24 hours, you are welcome again in the DAE building. If your test is positive please contact:

## Does DAE follow all the given rules by the Dutch health institution RIVM?

The rules that are given to DAE by the RIVM are leading. To follow these rules is the only option for DAE to remain open and to provide a safe environment. It is therefore of great importance that each and every one of us complies with these rules.


## Is our building, De Witte Dame, appropriately equipped concerning ventilation in relation to Covid-19?

DAE has a ventilation system that brings fresh air into the building. Used air is blown out of the building via a separate channel. We do not have a recirculation system.

In August 2020 we invited experts to measure our ventilation system and to advise us. The outcome of the research is that the installation blows sufficient fresh air into the building to meet the standards in the Buildings Decree in combination with the occupancy as we apply it.  

Although the installation blows sufficiently, there is always room for improvement, which we are working on. We have already increased the air intake capacity to its maximum. 

Keeping windows and doors open, preferably those opposite each other, will support our measures but is not necessary, especially during wintertime.  Our occupancy rate does not need to be adapted.  Finally, needless to say that these efforts will only have effect if we stick to the rules of 1.5-metre distancing, regularly wash our hands, cough in our elbow and stay home when we have (even mild) symptoms.


## Are we obliged to wear a facemask?
 
Yes, when you are moving around in the building it is obligatory to wear a facemask. Mask-wearing is compulsory while moving around, but wearing a mask while seated is a personal decision. This is in line with the measures put in place by the government. Under no circumstances is it appropriate for tutors, staff or students to ask anyone within the community to remove a mask while in the building, even if it is hard to understand what someone is saying.


## I am a Bachelor student, how are the starting times of our classes decided?

In July, all BA heads have received an email asking which time would suit them most. We have tried to take this into consideration as much as possible.


## Is it possible to postpone my studies?

Answer Bachelors:  It is possible to defer your admittance for one year. If you want to postpone, you can send an email to < admission@designacademy.nl> and state the reason for your request.

Answer Masters:  It is possible to defer your admittance for one year. If you want to postpone, you can send an email to < admission@designacademy.nl> and state the reason for your request. You have to pay the deposit of €500 to be sure we keep your place for next year.  Next year we will settle the deposit with the tuition fee.



## If you have already postponed one year, is it possible to postpone a year again due to Corona?

This depends on so many different factors. We refer directly to our student counsellor.

## I’m from the UK. How does Brexit affect my studies during this period?
Please check the website from the government of the Netherlands for [updates](https://www.government.nl/topics/brexit/brexit-where-do-we-stand)

## Are the tuition fees and/or institutional tuition fees going to change?
