# DAE EDITORIAL TEAM

The DAE editorial team has been set up to support the communication of activities, ideas, and processes taking place within the institution. 

Formed in November 2020, the core team consists of three former DAE students with experience in design, journalism, communications and curation, and is part of a wider communications team that includes specialists in events, production and PR.

Following its initial bedding-in period, the role of the Editorial Team was assessed in April 2021. With the addition of Ilka van Steen as creative publisher, it will continue its activities as part of the Communications, Presentations and PR department.

---

## MISSION STATEMENT

The editorial team represents the Academy’s community internally and externally through vibrant, honest and dynamic communications and editorial content. It aims to break down communication silos and walls between the Executive Board, staff, teachers, the student body, the wider DAE community and the world. 

The editorial team will enable members of the community to share their ideas and work with each other and with the world. It will provide platforms for and actively promote criticality and ‘making public’.

The editorial team wants to affect and support positive change within DAE. It will listen to and amplify voices from within the student body. It hopes to be an exemplar of openness, generosity, engagement, transparency and communication, setting a standard for communications in institutions across design education.

---

## OPEN CALL

The editorial team provides a platform for the DAE community to share content and ideas through the school's various channels, including the website and social media. 

There is currently an ongoing open call for content on social media – particularly focussed on the DAE Instagram. All ideas for content are welcome, including the sharing of information about student- or staff-run events, projects, collaborations and exhibitions. These can be submitted to <communications@designacademy.nl>. The team can also be contacted via DM on [DAE's Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/designacademyeindhoven/).

## PROGRESS UPDATES

## 4 March 2021

— Recent progress
In the period since the last update, the team has built on its initial progress and introduced a number of new initiatives. 

These include:
→A new hub for Inclusivity & Culture content on the DAE website, creating a Q&A around this subject and acting as a conduit for feedback where appropriate

→Weekly updates about forthcoming DAE events on Instagram Stories, including student and tutor-driven projects like the Minor exhibitions and Critical Inquiry Lab radio

→A shift towards sharing more student-led initiatives on Instagram, particularly in Stories

→A new events update on the DAE website, bringing together disparate communications strands into one place

→Bi-weekly meetings with members of the Student Council to discuss ongoing projects and key issues emerging among the student body

→Meetings with the Lecture Committee to explore how the team can support this programme

→Meetings with MA class representatives to introduce the Editorial Team as a step towards encouraging students to engage directly with content submissions and promoting their work on the DAE channels

→Continued development of communications and PR strategy, contacting new media collaborators and exploring alternative avenues to promote student work beyond the Graduation Show

→Development of monthly DAE Letter to surface more archive and external content

→Ongoing support for internal Covid-19 communications and communications around the development of education within DAE

→Communications and support for student recruitment, including BA and MA open days, which were delivered online for the first time. This included experimenting with new platforms, including Snapchat. 

— New projects

The team has also begun work on a number of ongoing projects, focusing on new platforms and technologies such as Minecraft and Augmented Reality, to reflect some of the experimental work being undertaken within the school. These are being explored in tandem with other more traditional initiatives to support the key goals of building bridges within the DAE community and the world, including:

→Developing a photography and interview series focusing on experiences of first-year students during the pandemic

→Begun work on an interview series with community members, including new research professors and DAE Lecture Committee. This project aims to put faces to names and initiatives within the DAE community, which is of particular importance in light of the current restrictions on gathering within the DAE building

→A new Instagram Filter competition for the entire DAE community, exploring the wider potential of Instagram as a creative platform. This is due to be introduced in March 2021

→Developing ideas for a database and newsletter for open calls and other external opportunities, aimed at both alumni and current students

→Further conceptual work towards establishing an editorial channel on DAE website

→Minecraft research project, investigating the potential of this platform as an experimental communications channel for DAE
\
\
## 18 December 2020

— First steps
In the four weeks since it was founded, the editorial team has begun to implement initiatives towards the goals outlined in its Mission Statement:

→  Established an initial collaboration with the Student Council. A member of the Student Council is invited to attend the editorial team’s weekly meetings on a bi-monthly basis, and there is an open invitation for ongoing collaboration on an ad-hoc basis. 

→  Set up an ongoing Open Call for content for DAE’s social media platforms to all students and staff. This is part of our effort to improve representation across the DAE communications platforms, reflect the daily life of the school and support student initiatives. 

→ Introduced a new, regular roundup of weekly events at DAE via Instagram stories, which will be published every Monday. Anyone within the DAE community can propose an event or activity to be included in this each week. 

→ Begun to create collaborative relationships with students, staff and tutors to create a bridge between areas of expertise and help identify ‘blind spots’ within DAE’s communications

→ Started to establish open and honest external communication about the steps being taken by the Academy to advance safety and inclusivity in an institutional context.
\
\
— Next steps
In January, the team hopes to begin implementing the second round of initiatives towards our Mission Statement goals. These include:

→ Surface more of the daily activities within the school to better represent the reality of the creative process and student life at DAE. 

→ Find ways to engage students directly in the creation of content for the DAE social media channels and website, if there is interest in this. 

→ Introduce an area to curate and share editorial content on the DAE website and support members of the DAE community in identifying opportunities for and creating content to be published on the website. 

→ Learn from previous success with live broadcasts from The Arena and student radio projects and introduce more live content across platforms.
