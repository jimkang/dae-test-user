# EXECUTIVE BOARD

The DAE Executive Board is responsible for the overall management of the Academy and is in charge of the school's general administration. Members of the Executive Board are employed part-time and are appointed, suspended and dismissed by the DAE Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board also determines the remuneration for the members of the Executive Board.  
 
Studio Leaders (BA), Department Heads (MA), coordinators and tutors are accountable for the curriculum, acting under the overall supervision of the Executive Board.   
 
 The Academy’s Management Team is responsible for the overall support of the educational process and includes the Finance, Communications, HR and Operations teams.

The Design Academy Foundation was set up by notarial deed on 21 February 1947. 

In accordance with the provisions of the Higher Education and Academic Research Act (Wet Hoger Onderwijs & Wetenschappelijk Ondezoek), the separation of management and supervision is laid down in the statutes. The Executive Board (College van Bestuur) manages the academy and is accountable to the Supervisory Board (Raad van Toezicht) as statutory regulatory body.

The Supervisory Board of Design Academy Eindhoven aims for a diverse representation and is therefore made up of six members with various professional backgrounds in the worlds of culture, education, communication, business, finance and government.

# SUPERVISORY BOARD

The Supervisory Board is a legally required, independently appointed supervisory body that sits above the Executive Board of Design Academy Eindhoven. The Supervisory Board appoints the members of the Executive Board, and approves the budget and the annual statement of accounts. In addition, the Supervisory Board oversees the standards of the academy’s management and the education it offers. In doing so, it follows the Dutch Governance Code (Branchecode Governance), which is a system of basic principles and rules regarding good and adequate management and supervision. The Supervisory Board also acts as a sounding board for the Executive Board.

# MANAGEMENT TEAM

DAE's management team was overhauled in 2021 to better reflect the needs of the school and help clarify DAE's internal structure. The team consists of the heads of the MA and BA programmes, and the heads of finance, operations and communications.

The Management Team is responsible for overseeing both the educational and organisational aspects of the school. It reports to the Executive Board. 

It does not determine any of the curricula, which are set by the MA Heads and BA Studio Leaders, with advice and suggestions from the [BA and MA Course Committees](https://designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/dae/participation).

  DAE does not follow a typically hierarchical approach to education, but it
  does depend on a team of staff, educators and managers for both its day-to-day
  activities and its ongoing development. This organogram illustrates the lines
  of reporting and relationships between different management, organisation and
  educational roles within the school. Click on the title to view a larger
