# Participation

Educational institutions in the Netherlands are obliged to include some form of employee participation in their organisational structure. This is meant to ensure that the interests of the staff are reflected in decision making. However, DAE believes it is essential to give students, lecturers and staff a clear seat at the table. This is referred to internally as DAE Participation.

## Institutional Participation Council

Contact the IPC via [this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=JP0cLFxinkix_I90WDDqZyWpNj8jKSBCgGAjjNANzThUOFUxRVhBN0haODdIRlpHUEFERk9XUEdDQy4u) or via <ipc@designacademy.nl>

On 1 November 2020, DAE introduced new participation regulations to enable a structural change in the way this is carried out within the school.

Previously, participation was arranged by the Works Council and Student Council. From 2021, this will be replaced by an Institutional Participation Council (IPC), which brings together an elected group of teachers and students to form one representative body. The IPC will be complemented by course committees for the BA and MA programmes. The Student Council will become an informal student advisory council.

The IPC can influence decision-making within the Academy on many issues but is particularly involved with the strategic policies that govern the organisation of the Academy, the working conditions at DAE and the employee-employer relationship. It might examine proposals from the Executive Board on which consent or advisory rights rest, but also more general matters about the running of the school.

The IPC consists of a maximum of eight members. Four members are chosen from and by the staff, and four members are chosen from and by the students (one member is from the Student Council). The aim is to achieve a balanced representation of the various organisational units within the BA and MA programmes. The members are appointed for a period of two years.

Members must be employed by DAE or a registered student, meaning that freelancers and exchange students cannot participate. Members are required to commit to around two hours’ work a week.

Membership applications closed December 11, 2020. As the number of places for membership IPC exceeds the number of candidates, all candidates (four employees and two registered students) are appointed by the Executive Board as member of the new IPC for the duration of two years, starting from February 1, 2021.

The list of IPC members is as follows:

Student members:
Michelle Jonker – BA
Paul Schaffer – BA

Empolyee members:

Joop Aarts - Workshops

## Bachelor Course Committee

The Bachelor Course Committee (BCC) was set up at the beginning of 2020. It is an important DAE advisory body, concerned with the quality of education within the Bachelor programme for both students and staff. This course committee discusses education-related topics – for example, educational innovation. The committee consists of two student representatives and two teacher representatives in paid positions.

The current student members are:
Will Tisschaw Billany, Propaedeutic Year
Lewis Duckworth, year three, Public Private 

The teacher members are:
Allard Roeterink, tutor Propaedeutic Year/Minor Making Futures/Elective Experimental Zoo, content coordinator Basics, Electives, Minors
Eibert Draisma, tutor Propaedeutic Year / tutor Studio Turn Around!

The BCC gives advice, proposes ideas and is consulted for the approval of some decisions in regards to the education within the Bachelor programme. 

The committe gives solicited and unsolicited advice on all aspects of the educational programmes and checks if changes are in line with the Teaching and Examinations Regulations (TER, in Dutch: OER). It communicates closely with the student body, as well as having a strong relationship with the Student Council and the Executive Board and is actively working with these groups to address, discuss and act on improvements to the education within the school. The BCC can also propose improvements and put issues on the agenda of the Participation Council. 

The committee strives to contribute to an attitude of transparency within the school and to enable students to take the lead in their education and their development as designers. It aims to be a safe space that encourages discussions of course-related topics relevant to the Bachelor programme at DAE. 

The BCC meets around eight times a year. Students and teachers remain members for two years. Each member will be compensated for 42 hours on a yearly basis.

If you have any questions or topics you would like raise with the BCC please contact them via this email: <BachelorCourseCommittee@designacademy.nl>.

## Master Course Committee

The Master Course Committee (MCC) will be an important DAE advisory body, concerned with the quality of the education of the Master programme for both students and staff. 

Echoing the structure of the BCC, the committee consists of two teacher representatives and two student representatives. Giving solicited and unsolicited advice on all aspects of the educational programme and proposing ideas, the MCC is consulted for the approval of some decisions in regards to the education within the Master courses to check if changes are in line with the Teaching and Examinations Regulations (TER, in Dutch: OER). 

The MCC also communicates closely with the student body, as well as having a strong relationship with the Student Council and the Executive Board, actively working with these groups to address, discuss and act on improvements around education within the school. The MCC can also propose improvements and put issues on the agenda of the Participation Council. 

The MCC strives to contribute to an attitude of transparency within the school and to enable students to take the lead in their education and their development as designers, while aiming to be a safe space that encourages discussions of course-related topics relevant for the Master courses at DAE.

The MCC will meet around eight times a year. Participating students and teachers will remain members of the MCC for two years. Each member of the MCC will be compensated for 42 hours on a yearly basis.
