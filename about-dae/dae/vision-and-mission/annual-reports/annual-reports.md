→ [Quality Agreements 2019-2024](https://www.designacademy.nl/Portals/0/www/Quality_Agreements_Plan_doublepages.pdf)

This document describes the plan Design Academy Eindhoven has formulated in consultation with students, teachers and staff in light of the quality agreements. The intentions laid out in this document can be directly linked to the themes of the Strategic Agenda of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW) and therewith the common agenda of the VSNU, VH, ISO and LSVB:

1. Intensive and Small-Scale Education
2. More and Better Guidance of Students.
3. Study Success.
4. Differentiation of Education.
5. Appropriate and Good Educational Facilities.
6. Improving the Professional Quality of Teachers.

The plans are consistent with the policy framework described in the Institutional Plan 2018, with the sharpening of the academy’s vision. Financial backing is guaranteed by pre investments in 2015–2018 focused on the curriculum renewal of the BA programme.
