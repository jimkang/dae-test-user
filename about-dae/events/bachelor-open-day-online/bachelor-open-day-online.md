# BACHELOR OPEN DAY ONLINE

On Wednesday, 20 January 2021 we're hosting an Open Day for the BA departments online from 12:00-17:00 CET. If you'd like to attend the event please sign up [here](https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/design-academy-eindhoven-bachelors-open-day-registration-132378249909).

Our annual open days are there to give prospective students an introduction to the school and its courses. The objective of the open days is to help each individual understand whether this is the right space for them to continue their education and develop a critical and practical understanding of design. Anyone is welcome to attend!
