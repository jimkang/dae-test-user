# BACHELOR OPEN DAY
Design Academy Eindhoven hosts annual open days for all of its departments to give prospective students an introduction to the school and its courses. Anyone is welcome to attend. The objective of the open days is to help each individual understand whether this is the right space for them to continue their education and develop a critical and practical understanding of design. 

The next open day will take place on June 23, 2021 from 12:00-5:00 PM CEST and is fully online.

How it works:
This event online and is arranged across several digital ‘rooms’, each with a different programme that you can explore at your own pace from 12:00 till 5:00 PM, CEST. You can hop from one room to another and meet students, representatives from the Student Council and student administration, as well as the student counsellor, to ask questions and find inspiration.
