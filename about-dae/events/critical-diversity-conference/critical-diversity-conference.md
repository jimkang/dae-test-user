# CRITICAL DIVERSITY CONFERENCE
October 18 & 19, Beursgebouw Eindhoven
7 PM - 10 PM 

Diversity and inclusivity are urgent topics that are too often used to make institutions look good, instead of being used as tools to truly enable a sense of belonging. This urgent topic within art and design education is being addressed in the Critical Diversity Conference at the Graduation Show. The conference is organised and led by Dr Praveen Sewgobind, as part of the Diversity & Inclusion Professorship.

The two-day event will include keynote lectures and panel discussions following three themes â€” Breathing, Becoming and Belonging. The intention is to stimulate theories and practices that can transform cultures that create an unequal distribution of power and privilege in higher education and wider society. 

Amongst the speakers will be Kaylee Rosalina, Eline Pollaert, Aminata Cairo and Tingting Hui. Each speaker and panellist bringing an expert point of view on the wide topic of diversity. 

The conference will be in a hybrid format, online and offline. If you wish to attend the conference, please click on [this link](https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/tickets-critical-diversity-conference-171924469717) and register via eventbrite.
