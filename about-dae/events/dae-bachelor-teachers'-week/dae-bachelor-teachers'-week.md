## DARE TO LEARN: THE ART AND CRAFT OF LEARNING

→ Date: Monday 29 March – Thursday 1 April 2021 

Education is constantly changing. To help you navigate this, DAE is organising a number of sessions for teachers; to learn together, with and from each other.

During this Teachers' Week, you can sign-up for one or more sessions to work together with your colleagues from DAE on several subjects and themes. For example, learning by queering, feedback culture, inclusivity, the teacher as a coach and the student’s agency in learning. There will be plenty of opportunities to get involved in conversations, receive input and think about what the outcomes of these discussions and the week can mean for your own practice.

The Teachers' Week kicks off on 29 March – Monday morning – after which there is a wide choice of (online) sessions you can follow. In addition to a number of work sessions where learning from each other's expertise has a central role, there is also time to be inspired by the presentation of an educational concept and the possibility to follow lecture sessions by Praveen Sewgobind, Ian Biscoe and Annika Frye, as well as a workshop on Wednesday about Diversity & Inclusivity with workshop leaders from outside DAE.
