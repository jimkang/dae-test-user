# DAE LECTURE SERIES with Goda Palekaitė

As agents of liminal practices, Palekaitė’s subjects of study engage in conversations without considering their geographical and temporal differences. In her performances, installations and publications, Sappho (6th century BC) discusses the failures of democracy with Mikhail Bakunin (19th century), and Michel Leiris (20th century) engages in an exchange about dreams with Emanuel Swedenborg (18th century). Memories, semblances and ideas connect in a different temporality than official linear history – in a cyclical and intimate space. The artist collects pieces of historical leftovers without glorifying any factual information – instead, trying to highlight her personal relationship to historical characters, share dreams, desires and inner transitions with them. Palekaitė explores how far the thoughts can be traced, unmasking the illusion of authentic creativity and allowing her to establish dissident connections.

In this lecture, Palekaitė will share her hybrid research approach informed by artistic, historical, ethnographic and literary methods and practices. It will discuss the inclination to trespass the boundaries of specific artistic and academic disciplines, and, thus, to explore liminal territories of knowledge.
