# DAE LECTURE SERIES with Ruben Pater
CAPS LOCK: How capitalism took hold of design, and how to escape from it
27th May 2021, 19 CET

# ABOUT THE LECTURE:
Capitalism could not exist without the coins, banknotes, documents, information graphics, interfaces, branding, and advertising made by graphic designers. Even strategies such as social design and speculative design are easily appropriated to serve economic growth. It seems design is locked in a cycle of exploitation and extraction, furthering inequality and environmental collapse. CAPS LOCK is an upcoming book by Ruben Pater at Valiz Publishers that uses clear language and visual examples to show how graphic design and capitalism have come to be inextricably linked. The book features designed objects, but also examines how the professional practice of designers itself supports capitalism. Six radical graphic design collectives are featured that resist capitalist thinking in their own way, inspiring a more sustainable and less exploitative practice of design.
