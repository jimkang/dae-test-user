# Feel The Vibe II: Working Through Conditions / Conditioning
Opening program: 13:00-14:00, 16 October 2021 
Installation on view: 16 October 2021 - 1 April 2022
Address: Eindhoven Airport, Luchthavenweg 25, 5657 EA Eindhoven

Installation at Eindhoven Airport by Hokjesdenkers, Percolate Collective, and re_move: three student collectives of MA Social Design, Design Academy Eindhoven. In the multifaceted project Working Through Conditions / Conditioning, second year MA Social Design students at the Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE) explore the legacy of De Stijl. This art movement is an aesthetic lingua franca that helped shape the formation of Dutch national design. Inspired by De Stijl, three installations displayed in the airport forecourt examine the ways in which artworks, airports and national iconography perform citizenship.

Engaging with both objects in the collection of the Van Abbemuseum and the elements of airport design, the three installations offer visitors different ways of seeing, listening to and moving through the space of Eindhoven Airport. These interventions are the result of a series of workshops, gatherings and lectures that took place at the DAE and the Van Abbemuseum.
