# GEO—DESIGN: Budget Airlines, We Are All The Jet Set*

## 9 October—14 November 2021, Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven

---

GEO—DESIGN: Budget Airlines, We Are All The Jet Set* is an exploration of low-fare airlines as a cultural and economic phenomenon. Operating on a business model that minimises operational costs, unbundles fares, reduces customer services, and decentralises routes, low-fare airlines have in the past 30 years shaped the worldwide aviation industry as we know it. 

Nine design research projects explore how budget airlines impact our everyday life at many scales of observation — from corporate sovereignty to international boundaries, from small airports to global carbon credit market, from material commodities to digital services, from environmental impact to unsolved trials. Through data analysis, image research, performance, oral histories, speculation, personification and sound modelling, it is demonstrated how ‘cheap’ is not just a price but a way of looking at the world.

*(Taxes, fees and charges apply)

This exhibition is the latest instalment in a series created out of the DAE Geo—Design platform, which generates original research into complex contemporary systems in the form of design explorations and investigations.
