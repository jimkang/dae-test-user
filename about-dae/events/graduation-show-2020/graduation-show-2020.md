# GRADUATION SHOW 2020

Over the past few years, the Design Academy Eindhoven’s Graduation Show has become an eagerly anticipated annual event, with each edition drawing tens of thousands of visitors from across the world. This year, the external circumstances have pushed us to adapt beyond the physical event that we had hoped and planned for. Considering the international nature of our graduates, combined with the large scale of the event, it became clear at the eleventh hour that it was [no longer feasible](https://designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/news/graduation-show-2020-only-virtually) to host a large-scale exhibition. 

Amidst the unpredictability that this year has brought, being able to exchange our thoughts and ideas is still as important as ever. As a result, our graduates’ work will be presented publicly in a number of new ways: by making the most of the digital platforms at our disposal, we strive for their work to reach an even wider audience than before. Fundamentally, the function of all this remains the same: to proudly showcase the work of 184 graduates, who have shown immense adaptability and resilience in creating their projects this past year. 

→ GRADUATION SHOW 2020 @ VIRTUAL DDW 
The Graduation Show is part of the [virtual edition](https://ddw.nl/en/virtual-tours/10/graduation-show-2020) of Dutch Design Week. You now have the possibility to visit a virtual exhibition of each of Design Academy’s eight bachelors’ departments; Leisure, Food Non Food, Communication, Identity, Well-Being, Public Private, Motion, and Activity, alongside our four masters’ departments; Social Design, Contextual Design, Information Design, and The Critical Inquiry Lab. In each exhibition, graduates will display their work in 3D viewing rooms, where you also have the opportunity to connect with them, watch videos and more.

→ THE GRADUATION CATALOGUE
All the projects [can be found](https://designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/graduation-show/graduation-projects) on the freshly launched website of the Design Academy, where each student has their own project page featuring pictures, written descriptions, podcasts, and more.  In addition to this, the projects are permanently archived in the fantastically designed Graduation Catalogue, available at the Design Academy Eindhoven: Emmasingel 14 (2nd floor) or via [ideabooks.nl](https://www.ideabooks.nl) from November onwards. 

→ THE ARENA - DIALOGUES ON DESIGN 
Showcasing the excellence of graduates’ work, and with design research at its heart, The Arena is Design Academy Eindhoven’s own platform for debate and discussion. During the virtual Dutch Design Week, The Arena will be broadcasting live from the Design Academy’s Instagram twice a day, with presentations, discussions and performances from graduates at 12:00 and 18:00. Additionally, as in previous years, you can join us for daily panel discussions between Graduates and prominent professionals from 14:30-15:30 on [DDW TV](https://ddw.nl/). In addition to this, graduates will have also their own online radio show, that can be listened to daily at [RaRaRadio](https://www.rararadio.org).

GRAPHIC AND EDITORIAL CONCEPT 

For the campaign and Graduation catalogue, a series of hypothetical news headlines have been generated by an [open-source tool](http://gs20editorial.online/) that has been fed with the written descriptions of all projects. By viewing the work as a dataset, the collective (sub)consciousness of the graduates is revealed, and the assorted headlines unveil surprising trends, methodologies, biases, and desires that allow for new connections to be made between the projects. This editorial concept can be explored at a greater depth in the catalogue.
