Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE) is delighted to present the Graduation Show 2021, which will take place from 16 - 24 October during Dutch Design Week. 

DAE is very pleased to be able to return to a physical exhibition format and share the new graduates’ work with the world. The show will be located at the Beursgebouw, in the centre of Eindhoven. 

The Graduation Show 2021 offers new avenues to present the graduation projects, with an expansive public programme from the Arena and graduate presentations hosted on DAE's new hybrid platform the Stage. 

New this year is the Critical Diversity Conference, which addresses the urgent topics of diversity and inclusivity within art and design education. 

During the exhibition, DAE will announce the winners of the DAE awards. This will include the first winner of the Planetree Design Award, presented together with the Dutch Association of Mental Health and Addiction Care (GGzE).
