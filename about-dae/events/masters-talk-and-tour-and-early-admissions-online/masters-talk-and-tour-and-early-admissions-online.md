# MASTERS TALK&TOUR AND EARLY ADMISSIONS ONLINE

---

On Tuesday, 12 January 2021 we're hosting this year's MA Talk&Tour event online. Register now for DAE’s MA Talk&Tour event. Once you have successfully registered, you will receive a unique code to enter DAE online during the event.

Every year, DAE offers prospective students the chance to get a taste of what it’s like to study at the Academy and get a sneak peek into the workings of each of its five Master’s courses with a Talk&Tour event.

After the virtual Talk&Tour, the Academy will also open the first round of MA admissions with the Early Admissions programme also taking place online.

During the Talk&Tour, participants can take a virtual tour of the Academy building and join live seminars hosted by each department.  Prospective students can meet the department heads, tutors and alumni as well as current students.

The Student Council, student administration and student counsellor will also host online meet-and-greets to help answer practical questions about student life, visas, diplomas and the application procedure.

The Talk&Tour starts at 10:00 CET. 
The virtual tour of DAE is open until 13:00 CET.
The full programme, including seminars and meet-and-greet opportunities, will be published soon.
