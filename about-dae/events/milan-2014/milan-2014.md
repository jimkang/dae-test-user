# SALONE DEL MOBILE 2014

In Milan, we focus even more on the dichotomie between objects and issues, between tactile and virtual. Our alumni, some of them just recently graduated in december, will present a lively program of interventions, things, films and .... bingo.

We will unselfishly share our location in Milan with Het Nieuwe Instituut, Zuiderzeemuseum, Textielmuseum and chp....? jewelry by Gijs Bakker. On monday 7 April the Dutch Consulate invites all her guests for the network- and opening event in our location, Lambretto Art Project.
