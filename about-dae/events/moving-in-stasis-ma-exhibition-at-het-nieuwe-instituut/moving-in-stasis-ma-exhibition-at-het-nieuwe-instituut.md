Launching on 8 March 2021, this hybrid exhibition is accessible online at [movinginstasis.com](https://www.movinginstasis.com/), culminating in a digital public programme from 8 - 11 April.

Design Academy Eindhoven presents Moving in Stasis, an unfolding exhibition and public programme that revisits and recasts the Academy’s Master graduation projects from 2020. Until this time, these projects have been kept in storage, awaiting their moment of display. In collaboration with Het Nieuwe Instituut, sixty works are transplanted to Gallery 3 By You, six months after the moment of graduation.

Moving in Stasis is an exhibition of its own making. Constructed as an evolving set-piece and culminating in a digital public programme, participants will occupy a hybrid structure over five weeks, formed in three acts: Installation, Production, and Public Programme. Entirely curated, designed, and developed by the graduates themselves, the exhibition disentangles and re-stages performance, film screenings, objects, writings, radio broadcasts, and more. With topics ranging from narratology to modalities of care, craft choreographies
to invisible architectures, viewers and visitors are granted a behind the scenes insight into the working processes of sixty designers. 

While acknowledging the unexpected disruptions and chains of contingencies that accompany opening an exhibition during the ongoing pandemic, Moving in Stasis offers a dynamic and flexible space
for new ideas, collaboration, and dialogue. The exhibition utilises the museum as a site for production, functioning as a set for the creation of content that will ultimately be presented in digital space. It marks a collective attempt to move forward, delivering new perspectives on individual practice and the creation of a reflexive, critical space at this moment in time.
