# OPENING ACADEMIC YEAR 2021

On August 31 we look forward to welcoming the new first year students to Design Academy Eindhoven! This year will unfortunately not see a return to our traditional gathering, against the backdrop of a worldwide pandemic and big changes to the way we all work, teach and learn. Due to rise of infections and consideration of group sizes, only new first years will be able to attend this event physically. The board will organise an online welcome to the entire DAE community on August 31.
