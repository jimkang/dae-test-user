# SENSE NONSENSE AT VAN ABBEMUSEUM

Science and engineering enjoy and even indulge in their reputation for serious research. These disciplines garner respect for remaining focused on making the world a safer and better place. Scientific research is considered serious business.

Art and design have a less stellar reputation for crucial research. The general public tends to assume that the freedom afforded to the more creative disciplines inevitably results in more imaginative, but less critically significant inquiries.

This exhibition takes a closer look at this artificial dichotomy, between art and science, and between the role of the designer and the engineer. An integrated relationship between sense and nonsense is explored to reveal that across all disciplines a dose of both is not only evident, but vital. 
It is never as simple as it looks. Even the most nonsense of projects contain a core of serious investigation.
