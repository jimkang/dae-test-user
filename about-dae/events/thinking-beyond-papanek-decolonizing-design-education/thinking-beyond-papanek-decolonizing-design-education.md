As a designer, critic, and teacher, Victor Papanek has left a great mark on thinking about design, and the teaching and research practice around design in particular. While his influence is indisputable, for many young designers and thinkers, some of his ideas are in need of revision. They are aware of the dominance of a Euro- and Anglo-centric view on design, and see that things must and can be done differently. The world of design is also subject to a process of decolonization. How does that process take shape in education, design practice and established institutions in the field of design? How do designers and teachers themselves view this issue?

In a panel discussion, we will discuss these and other questions with Brazilian, Berlin-based artist Luiza Prado de O. Martins and other guests. The conversation will be led by Ama van Dantzig, entrepreneur and co-founder of Dr. Monk. The language of instruction for this program is English. Participation is free, sign up below to receive the webinar link.
