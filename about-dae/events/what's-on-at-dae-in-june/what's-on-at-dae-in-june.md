## MA GRADUATION CEREMONY
On June 17 we're gathering for the festive Masters' Graduation Ceremony. It has been a very challenging time and we feel proud and happy to be able to celebrate the graduates' achievements together. Due to Covid regulations, we will host two separate ceremonies (split by departments), and will only invite the graduates and necessary staff. The whole event will be streamed for family and friends.
