# WHAT’S ON AT DAE IN OCTOBER?

---

## GEO—DESIGN: Budget Airlines, We Are All The Jet Set*
9 October – 14 November, Van Abbemuseum

GEO—DESIGN: Budget Airlines, We Are All The Jet Set* is an exploration of low-fare airlines as a cultural and economic phenomenon. Operating on a business model that minimises operational costs, unbundles fares, reduces customer services, and decentralises routes, low-fare airlines have in the past 30 years shaped the world-wide aviation industry as we know it. Nine design research projects explore how budget airlines impact our everyday life at many scales of observation — from corporate sovereignty to international boundaries, from small airports to global carbon credit market, from material commodities to digital services, from environmental impact to unsolved trials. Through data analysis, image research, performance, oral histories, speculation, personification and sound modelling, it is demonstrated how ‘cheap’ is not just a price but a way of looking at the world.

# FEEL THE VIBE II: WORKING THROUGH CONDITIONS / CONDITIONING
Opening program: 13:00-14:00, 16 October 2021 
Installation on view: 16 October 2021 - 1 April 2022
Address: Eindhoven Airport, Luchthavenweg 25, 5657 EA Eindhoven

Installation at Eindhoven Airport by Hokjesdenkers, Percolate Collective, and re_move: three student collectives of MA Social Design, Design Academy Eindhoven. In the multifaceted project Working Through Conditions / Conditioning, second year MA Social Design students at the Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE) explore the legacy of De Stijl. This art movement is an aesthetic lingua franca that helped shape the formation of Dutch national design. Inspired by De Stijl, three installations displayed in the airport forecourt examine the ways in which artworks, airports and national iconography perform citizenship.

Engaging with both objects in the collection of the Van Abbemuseum and the elements of airport design, the three installations offer visitors different ways of seeing, listening to and moving through the space of Eindhoven Airport. These interventions are the result of a series of workshops, gatherings and lectures that took place at the DAE and the Van Abbemuseum.

## CRITICAL DIVERSITY CONFERENCE
October 18 & 19, 7 PM - 10 PM, Beursgebouw

Diversity and inclusivity are urgent topics that are too often used to make institutions look good, instead of being used as tools to truly enable a sense of belonging. This urgent topic within art and design education is being addressed in the Critical Diversity Conference at the Graduation Show. The conference is organised and led by Dr Praveen Sewgobind, as part of the Diversity & Inclusion Professorship.

The two-day event will include keynote lectures and panel discussions following three themes — Breathing, Becoming and Belonging. The intention is to stimulate theories and practices that can transform cultures that create an unequal distribution of power and privilege in higher education and wider society.
