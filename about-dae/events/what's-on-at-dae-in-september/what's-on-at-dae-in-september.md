# WHAT’S ON AT DAE IN SEPTEMBER?

---

## DAE GRADUATES AT SALONE DEL MOBILE 2021 
5-10 September 2021
 
We're going to Milan! From 5-10 September 2021, DAE is participating in the Fuorisalone of Salone del Mobile 2021 with an exhibition at Forni, a former industrial bakery in the centre of the city which will be opened to the public for the first time since its closure. Our BA graduates of 2020 will present their graduation projects to the world – some of them further activated and some in their original form. The DAE communications team is excited to work with curator Martina Muzi and creative director Joseph Grima alongside 2020 graduates on this exciting event! All members of our community are warmly welcomed to join us in person at the exhibition in Milan, or online. We look forward to sharing more information with you soon!

## KEYNOTE Beatriz Colomina
29 September 2021, 18:00—20:00

Design Academy Eindhoven is happy to invite you all to join us via [livestream](https://youtu.be/1g6pSyb5zyU) for a keynote lecture by architecture historian and theorist Beatriz Colomina on Wednesday 29 September 2021.

Colomina’s lecture will examine the paradigms of 20th Century health and architecture, challenging the normal understanding of modern architecture by proposing that it was shaped by the dominant medical obsession of its time: tuberculosis and its primary diagnostic tool, the X-ray.

The lecture draws upon her 2019 monograph ‘X-ray Architecture (Lars Müller Publishers), which traces the psychopathologies of twentieth-century architecture—from the trauma of tuberculosis to more recent disorders such as burn-out syndrome and ADHD—and the huge transformations of privacy and publicity instigated by diagnostic tools from X-Rays to MRIs and beyond.

This special event has been organised by the five DAE Master programmes, DAE communications & presentations department in collaboration with Kunstinstituut Melly (formerly Witte de With) and Het Nieuwe Instituut.

The lecture will take place in DAE’s auditorium, but space is very limited due to Covid-19. A free livestream of the event will be available [here](https://youtu.be/1g6pSyb5zyU).
