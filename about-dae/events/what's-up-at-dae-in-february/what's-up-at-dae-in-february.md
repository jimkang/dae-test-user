## GGZE LECTURE – MENTAL HEALTH

This lecture is part of DAE's ongoing collaboration with Eindhoven-based mental health organisation GCzE De Grote Beek. The speakers include GCzE director Bas van Oosterhout, clinical psychologist, and a variety of experts who will share their research and insights into dementia, depression, autism, and mental health in general. 

Launched in 2021, the collaboration between DAE and GCzE includes an annual award, lectures and excursions with mental health experts and students, and a yearly seminar on mental health during Dutch Design Week at [The Arena](https://designacademy.nl/p/research-and-debate/the-arena).

## DAE LECTURE SERIES with Goda Palekaitė 
Thursday 25 February 2021

As agents of liminal practices, Palekaitė’s subjects of study engage in conversations without considering their geographical and temporal differences. In her performances, installations and publications, Sappho (6th century BC) discusses the failures of democracy with Mikhail Bakunin (19th century), and Michel Leiris (20th century) engages in an exchange about dreams with Emanuel Swedenborg (18th century). Memories, semblances and ideas connect in a different temporality than official linear history – in a cyclical and intimate space. The artist collects pieces of historical leftovers without glorifying any factual information – instead, trying to highlight her personal relationship to historical characters, share dreams, desires and inner transitions with them. Palekaitė explores how far the thoughts can be traced unmasking the illusion of authentic creativity and allowing her to establish dissident connections.

In this lecture, Palekaitė will share her hybrid research approach informed by artistic, historical, ethnographic and literary methods and practices. It will discuss the inclination to trespass the boundaries of specific artistic and academic disciplines, and, thus, to explore liminal territories of knowledge. Registrations will open soon.

## ONLINE MINOR EXHIBITION

## COLLECTIVE MINOR - Studio Souvenir
In the past year a group of students experimented with creating their own education. They explored themselves as individuals and formed their collective body, Studio Souvenir. They traveled to the island of Madeira, to research the topic of tourism and souvenirs. Their journey was long, full of ups and downs. But most of all, full of moments of togetherness. Click here to get an insight to Studio Souvenir: [https://studiosouvenir.com/](https://studiosouvenir.com/)  and [https://www.instagram.com/studio_souvenir_](https://www.instagram.com/studio_souvenir_/)
