# WHAT’S ON AT DAE IN MARCH?

---

## DAE LECTURE SERIES with Priya Swamy
Can the revolution be institutionalised?
March 25, 19:00 CET

The title of this discussion moves forward from the legendary words of Gil Scott-Heron’s ‘The Revolution Will Not Be Televised’, to grapple with the position that advocacy, change, and revolution happens outside of the systems, institutions, and popular spaces that produce and reproduce systemic violence. If activism around decoloniality, anti-racism, and anti-facism is by its nature immediate, can institutions ever be a site of similar change, given that they reproduce deeply embedded, systematised, racialised orderings of time? By attempting to see curating and collection development as ‘adjacent practices’, we can imagine together both the limits and possibilities to fashion equitable futures through and with museum-based practices and collections. Examples from exhibition/display practices, the notion of ‘colonial failure’, and collecting anti-racism will serve as points of provocation.

## Thinking Beyond Papanek: Decolonizing Design Education: What’s on now and next?
In response to the exhibition Victor Papanek: The Politics of Design currently showing at Design Museum Den Bosch
Time: Thursday, 18 March 2021, 6 - 8pm CET
Guests : Luiza Prado de O. Martins, Michael Andrés Forero
Moderator : Ama van Dantzig

As a designer, critic, and teacher, Victor Papanek has left a great mark on thinking about design, and the teaching and research practice around design in particular. While his influence is indisputable, for many young designers and thinkers, some of his ideas are in need of revision. They are aware of the dominance of a Euro- and Anglo-centric view on design, and see that things must and can be done differently. The world of design is also subject to a process of decolonization. How does that process take shape in education, design practice and established institutions in the field of design? How do designers and teachers themselves view this issue?

In a panel discussion, we will discuss these and other questions with Brazilian, Berlin-based artist Luiza Prado de O. Martins and other guests. The conversation will be led by Ama van Dantzig, entrepreneur and co-founder of Dr. Monk. The language of instruction for this program is English.

## BACHELOR TEACHERS’ WEEK (DAE tutors only)
Dare to Learn: the Art and Craft of Learning
Monday 29 March – Thursday 1 April 2021

In week 13, we’re hosting the (BACHELOR) TEACHERS’ WEEK event online. Register now to receive more information in the weeks leading up to the event.

Education is constantly changing. To help you navigate this, DAE is organising a number of sessions for teachers; to learn together, with and from each other

During this Teachers’ Week, you can sign-up for one or more sessions to work together with your colleagues from DAE on several subjects and themes. For example, learning by queering, feedback culture, inclusivity, the teacher as a coach and the student’s agency in learning. There will be plenty of opportunities to get involved in conversations, receive input and think about what the outcomes of these discussions and the week can mean for your own practice.
