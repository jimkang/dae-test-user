## LECTURE SERIES WITH RUBEN PATER
27-05-2021 19:00 CET 

Save the date! We’re excited to welcome Ruben Pater to the Lecture Series, whose first book ‘The Politics of Design’ (2016) has been an inspirational source book for design students, tutors, and visual communicators worldwide. For a decade Pater worked in graphic design and advertising studios, after which he decided to start his own practice. Informed by his experience, Untold Stories produces critical work between graphic design, journalism, and activism. ‘CAPS LOCK’ is an [upcoming book](https://valiz.nl/en/publications/caps-lock.html) by Ruben Pater that uses clear language and visual examples to show how graphic design and capitalism have come to be inextricably linked.  Even strategies such as social design and speculative design are easily appropriated to serve economic growth. It seems design is locked in a cycle of exploitation and extraction, furthering inequality and environmental collapse.
