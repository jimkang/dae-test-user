# ZERO HUNGER, ZERO POWER

## 16 – 24 October, 11.00 – 18.00, Klokgebouw, Eindhoven

---

Design Academy announces Zero Hunger, Zero Power, an exhibition of work by current Master students, to be presented at the Klokgebouw during Dutch Design Week. 

Zero Hunger, Zero Power considers that it is not for a lack of global food production that people go hungry every day. Historical and contemporary geopolitical and economic factors result in manufactured surpluses and scarcities. Rather than rushing to sustain this system by designing ways to farm or produce even more food that doesn’t reach hungry people, what if design analyses the Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger as a question of power and access? How can design practices using image analysis, data science, investigative reporting, speculative fictioning, social media, archiving and eating invite a different understanding and negotiation of complex systems? 

The 11 design research projects presented in the exhibition are a selection of the projects developed by Design Academy Master students earlier this year, in collaboration with the Netherlands Food Partnership and MANN Design.
