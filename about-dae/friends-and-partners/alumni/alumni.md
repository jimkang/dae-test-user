# DAE ALUMNI

Design Academy Eindhoven's alumni include some of the world's most innovative and respected designers, business leaders, researchers and artists.

The school has maintained close connections with many of its alumni, who are invaluable in keeping the school connected to the world of design and industry. They regularly connect with current students to share their professional insights and how their education shaped their career, through social media, work placements and feedback sessions, as well as interviews and surveys that help shape DAE's approach.

Every year, DAE scouts for new teaching talent among its alumni. More than half of the current heads of the BA and MA programmes are DAE alumni. Former students teach current students in every BA studio and MA lab.

The commitment of DAE's alumni can also be seen in collaborative projects with the school and the regular internship slots offered to students. Many alumni come back to the school to seek inspiration and offer realistic business cases to current students.

The school is extremely appreciative of the wide variety of support provided by its alumni. To say thank you, alumni are invited to join lectures, participate in exhibitions and sit of juries. The annual Alumni Homecoming Breakfast that takes place during the Graduation Show is one of the highlights of the year, which offers former students early access to the exhibition and a chance to reconnect with their old classmates.
