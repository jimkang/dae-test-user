# DAE Alumni at Milan Design Week 2021

## After an 18-month hiatus, Milan Design Week returned for a special off-season edition in September, showcasing some of the world’s best-designed products and furniture, including a plethora of projects by Design Academy Eindhoven alumni.

---

Milan Design Week is the world’s largest design festival, encompassing the Salone del Mobile furniture fair and the Fuorisalone, a week of exhibitions and events around the city. Usually taking place in April, the 2020 edition was cancelled and the 2021 edition postponed and staged in a reduced form in September due to Covid-19. The Salone del Mobile dubbed its special edition the ‘Supersalone’, opening up to the public and incorporating showcases of young talent and talks.  

DAE’s most recent 2020 graduates were finally given a chance to show the world their work at the Supersalone’s The Lost Graduation Show and at Missed Your Call, an exhibition staged by DAE. Read more about them [here](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/news/missed-your-call-and-the-lost-graduation-show-at-milan-design-week-2021). But DAE alumni were out in force across the entire city during design week.

The Isola Design District, part of the Fuorisalone, produced five collective exhibitions along with various other events. The Stage Four exhibition focused on shapes and colours as a way to rethink the importance of physical and mental freedom that creates a unique global experience. DAE alumni Benedikt Stonawski and Hauke Unterburg (2016 graduates) of Ante Studio displayed their product ‘Patersonia’, a pendant lamp that can be put together with three identical flat metal discs. 

The exhibition also included ‘Archetype’, a furniture collection that incorporates ancient Roman architectural elements both structurally and visually, designed by Studio JOACHIM-MORINEAU, founded by Carla Joachim and Jordan Morineau, (2018 graduates), and work by Tellurico — a studio founded by 2017 graduate Francesco Pace — Celestine Peuchot (2017 graduate), Boey Wang and Teun Zwets (2020 graduates). 

Elsewhere in the same district, the Isola Design Gallery’s exhibition in a former wool factory showcased a selection of design pieces that included 2020 graduate Enrico Rapella’s project ‘Harvesting Heat’.

Tellurico was also a key part of the 5Vie district in Milan, presenting a performance ‘Untitled 1B, the second chapter’ that embodied his research into the relationship between labour and time. 

Anna-Sophie Dienemann, a 2020 DAE graduate, presented ‘Bounding Spaces’ in collaboration with the Goethe-Institute Milan at the exhibition titled We Will Design at BASE Milano. The exhibition also displayed projects curated by Parasite 2.0 that consisted of work by 2021 graduates Bruno Baietto and Jonas Hejduk. 

Fransje Gimbrère, a 2017 graduate, presented her work ‘Luxury Fences’ at the Dutch Pavillion in Milan exhibition, which for 2021 was named Masterly – The Dutch in Milano. Her project is an architectural embellishing textile created from metal that plays with the sense of perception.

The Rossana Orlandi Gallery also exhibited work of DAE graduates: Lucas Munoz Munoz’s (2014 graduate) ‘Tubular’ armchair and a wide variety of works by Piet Hein Eek (1990 graduate).

Alcova, a platform for independent design started by Space Caviar and Studio Vedèt, hosted an exhibition with over 50 international exhibitors that included DAE alumni such as Studio Benjamin Motoc, Matilde Patuelli, Ignacio Subías Albert, (2020 graduates) and Ismaël Rifaï and Héloïse Charital of Studiolow (2019 graduates) and Gianmaria Della Ratta (2019 graduate) and Giorgio Gasco (2018 graduate) of Studio Groovido. 

Also at Alcova, the Nilufar Gallery hosted an exhibition titled BRASSLESS examined the use and abuse of brass in design, a strong trend in the product and interior design world in recent years. The show highlights material potentiality and meaning through various projects that include Studio Minale-Maeda’s (2005 graduate) ‘Galvanic Bath’ and Anna Diljá Sigurðardóttir’s (2019 graduate) ‘Earthly Delights’.

The week also saw events such as the screening of a film ‘The Object Becomes’ by Alexandre Humbert, a DAE alumnus from 2013. His film shows conversations between curator Giovanna Massoni, nine different designers and himself that narrate the story of Belgian design at its historical moments. The film includes the work of OS_Studio, a Brussels based design studio co-founded by Thomas Lommée, another DAE alumnus and the leader of the Morning Studio at DAE, and Studio Plastique founders Theresa Bastek & Archibald Godts, 2017 graduates from the Academy. The film premiered during the Milan Design Week at Cinema Anteo, Milano.
