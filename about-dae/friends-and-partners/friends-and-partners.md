# FRIENDS OF DAE

Design Academy Eindhoven has close ties with the business community and has been supported in various ways by its community of collaborators, alumni, and friends for more than half a century.

Access to willing and open businesses and individual in industry is a key part of the school's programmes and indispensable to the personal and professional development of its students.

The assistance the school receives from the business community varies from financial support to intensive education projects, in which companies collaborate and cooperate closely with DAE students. These practical experiences and the support for new talent, provide our students with opportunities that offer valuable insights, helping them become more aware of their position and choices as a designer.

To create a framework for these collaborations and forms of support, DAE created the Friends of DAE group, which has realised a number of projects. Through these projects, students have been able to understand the potential social and economic implications of their work and the benefits of cooperating with experts and exchanging knowledge. 

As well as being part of our community, the Friends of DAE are also offered thanks in the form of benefits such as design lectures, tours and events organised by the school.
