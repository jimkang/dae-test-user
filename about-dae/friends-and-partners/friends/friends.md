## Friends

Investing in Education [intro]  

Performing at the highest level requires investing in the best teachers and resources to attract and train top talents from all over the world. The school receives a government grant from the government to fulfil its core tasks, but to excel and stay at the top, more financial support and involvement from the outside is required. Involvement of those who believe in the school's philosophy that design contributes to a more beautiful, better and more tolerant society.   

Will you help us?  

Friends of DAE [link vanuit Study / Collaborate]  

Design Academy Eindhoven has close ties with the business community and has been supported in various ways for more than half a century. The link with and access to these business partners is part of the program and indispensable for the development of our students. The support the school receives from the business community varies from financial support to intensive education projects, in which companies enter into close cooperation with our students.  

Thanks to our Friends we have noticed that the practical experience and supporting of talent gives our students more insight into their choice of progression and further development as a designer. The projects with our Friends deepen their knowledge of social and economic aspects of their work, the qualities of cooperation with experienced experts and the need to exchange knowledge.

Offering an Internship  

You have a design internship available, which is a compulsory part of the bachelor's program. The internship periods start in September or February each year and last 20 weeks. The main requirement is that the student is supervised by a professional designer employed by the company. Together with your company, the student makes an internship plan with learning objectives that the student wishes to achieve during the internship. Ideally, the student will receive his own appropriate assignment. More information or questions: internship@designacademy.nl.  


Providing a Workplace  

You have a professional workplace with skilled craftsmen and advanced equipment. By making time, people and equipment available, you enable graduate students (4th year bachelor students and 2nd year master students) to have their product realized in a professional manner. The questions, requirements and wishes posed by these graduate students form the starting point for your professionals to use their knowledge and expertise to develop new insights and ideas that they can use again for your professional customers. Our students learn to work together in a professional manner, to take planning into account, with priorities, enrich their communication skills and learn the jargon that fits your industry. More information or questions: friends@designacademy.nl.  


Implementing a Question?  

You have a design question and are looking for original insights and outside-of-the-box answers. DAE can help you with that. We think it is important that students learn to test their design skills in practice against realistic issues during their studies. Because of the busy education program, DAE has chosen to offer and implement design questions only for a group of students. We see that students' critical reflection often leads to a new way of looking at and thinking about the original question and is more easily accepted than from a consultancy. Students' work creates a climate for thinking carefully about the assignment and solutions, regardless of positions, positions and agreements. Do you dare and want to know more? friends@designacademy.nl.  

Looking for a Designer?  

Not all design questions are suitable for our students. Questions that focus on a clear end result ("our company would like a new chair for our collection." or "we have a space that needs to be decorated.") do not fit in our education, but can be answered perfectly by a DAE-alumnus . If you are unsure whether your question fits within DAE's education or are you looking for a designer, just contact us. We are happy to help you find the right solution: friends@designacademy.nl.  

Want to Donate?  

Every year you look forward to visit our Graduation Show for inspiration and listen to our graduatesâ€™ personal stories. Products you buy are always from designers who have studied at DAE. You have a warm heart for DAE and its philosophy and would like to remain involved in its developments and events. DAE has set up a foundation, Design Support foundation, especially for companies and individuals who prefer to be involved sideways. Design Support has a cultural ANBI status. This allows you to deduct 1.5 times the amount of this donation in your corporate income tax return if your company is subject to corporation tax. For private individuals, when you calculate your taks deduction, you may increase the gift by 25%. Knowing more? friends@designacademy.nl.  

Sponsoring an Event?  

Design is more than just the design of products. Design is a way of thinking, a way of connecting, respecting each other in the creation of a product or service. As a company or institution, you find this important to support these values. You think it is important that DAE continues to present the many graduation projects during, for example, Dutch Design Week (October) or during the international furniture fair in Milan (April). These presentations contribute to your values and radiate the innovative character of your company. Depending on your investment, we discuss with the DAE Creative Director how we can best shape your involvement in an event. We look forward to receiving your email: friends@designacademy.nl.
