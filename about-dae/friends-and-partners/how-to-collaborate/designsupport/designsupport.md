# STICHTING DESIGN SUPPORT
Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE) has a responsibility to deliver high quality education, which allows students to develop their talents and successfully put them to use. And we are faced with the growing task of preparing students for their careers after they leave the academy. Increasing their knowledge in legal matters, developments in society and social interests will make it easier for them to become successful designers. Our intention is to make expertise and support available to students and graduates, in the shape of money, resources, or people.

To make sure we can deliver on this intention, DAE established the Stichting Design Support on 1 June 2010.

Students, graduates and alumni can turn to the foundation for a contribution / loan for activities such as manufacturing a prototype, establishing a business, or applying for a patent. Students must make a motivated request and explain and demonstrate how our support will further the development of their talents. Experts from within the academy assess the applications. This is the strength of the Stichting Design Support: the network that DAE has established contains all the necessary knowledge and expertise to ensure a successful pairing of design with entrepreneurship. Upon approval of the application, the student and the foundation will sign a contract containing agreements on support and guidance, advice, and matters concerning copyrights and quantifiable results.

The Stichting Design Support is qualified as a Public Benefit Organisation (PBO) or in Dutch Algemeen Nut Beogende Instelling (ANBI). Natural and legal persons donating to the Stichting Design Support may deduct their gifts from their Dutch income tax or corporate income tax.

# THE FOUNDATION’S OBJECTIVES

 - Enhance the educational environment at DAE, enable and support education to boost quality;
 - Within DAE’s design community, we want to foster initiative, inclusion, talent and innovation through financial aid or
   scholarships; 
 - Build a strong community of alumni and provide life-long learning opportunities;
 - Build a strong community of lovers with a passion for design, recognizing the importance of fundraising;
 - Awarding and promoting of school awards and grants; 
 - To promote the development and realisation of design and all matters relating to design and the promotion of design, either directly or indirectly;
 - Design Support’s efforts to realise these objectives include offering both material and immaterial support to people and organisations whose intentions are to promote and facilitate design;
 - Making a profit is not part of Design Support’s objectives.
