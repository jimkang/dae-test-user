City Circles is a research methodology, investigating the human factor within an urban circle with a diameter of one kilometre. City Circles inspires, activates and shows the ability and resilience of man to shape their lives in any given urban microclimate. In spring 2020, eleven DAE-students of bachelor department Leisure, researched Almada, a municipality right across the river Tagus from Lisbon, Portugal, within the principle of City Circles.  

The centre of the circle was Casa da Cerca in Almada, a centre for art and design, surrounded with a beautiful garden. The students research the area based on the following themes: Learning, Food, Materiality, Craftsmanship, Flora/ Fauna, Human Interaction, Health and Economy. The research leads to 19 design projects with proposals and interventions for Almada. 

In collaboration with Ketter&Co, Design Academy Eindhoven and Casa da Cerca, City Circles Almada is presented as a poster exhibition in Almada and as a virtual exhibition taking over the Casa da Cerca Instagram during the summer every Wednesday from the 22nd of June on. Due to Covid-19 the physical exhibition is postponed and took place from the 5th till 12th of September. 

“Cut out” is the outcome of a 5-month research and design project in a circle of one kilometre around Casa da Cerca in Almada by students of DAE.
