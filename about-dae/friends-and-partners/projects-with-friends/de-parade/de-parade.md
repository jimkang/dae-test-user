# Tackling the challenge of social distancing in the cultural sector: DAE x De Parade

## Students from DAE’s Studio Urgencies have collaborated with nomadic theatre festival De Parade to tackle one of the biggest challenges facing the cultural sector as a result of Covid-19 – how to maintain social distancing while offering a meaningful, engaging experience.

Between September 2020 and February 2021, this collaborative project sought to answer the question: ‘1.5 Metre! How?’.

De Parade is a nomadic theatre festival, which travels around the Netherland’s five biggest cities each summer offering visitors a world of small theatre performances, good food and drinks. The collaboration between Studio Urgencies (the DAE bachelor department, led by art director and artist Irene Fortuyn) and De Parade focussed on the consequences of the 1.5-metre society that has emerged due to the Covid-19 virus. What does social distancing really mean for the organisation of theatre performances, visitor flow, mobility and accessibility in and to the city, bicycle parking, waiting for performances, food and drink, the camping site, the shape of the tents, the cycle and logistics of building and dismantling, the comings and goings of actors and employees, etc.?

On 8 September 2020, around 20 second- and fourth-year students met with members of De Parade in Amsterdam to begin the process of understanding its approach to performance art and audience engagement (see two top images on the right). Six months later, they presented their work to De Parade.

The wide range of projects provided a rich source of inspiration and new insight for De Parade. They included products and tools for social distancing, alternative ways of performances and programming to podcasts and new apps.

Two projects were selected to be a part of De Parade’s programme for summer 2021. Huidhonger (see right column), a concept designed by Linda Huijbers, is an installation in which participants wash each other’s hands, creating a moment of connection. City Nomad (see video in left column), a product designed and made by Eva Jagerman, is a multifunctional blanket that can be used as a tarp, hammock, poncho, pillow and a bag.

A number of the other concepts presented by fourth-year students can also be viewed on this page in video form, including:

Alexandra Koutsaftis, Sense of Intimacy
Dongwook Jang, De-Parade
Emma Lijsman, Bursting bubbles
Eva Jagerman, City Nomad
Pierre Allain, Future nostalgia

'Our original plans to hold De Parade in Eindhoven had to be put on hold due to Covid-19, but fortunately out collaboration with DAE did not!' said Nicole van Vessum, director of De Parade. 'It has been an inspiring project, searching together for solutions to host the event safely while staying true to the spirit of De Parade. The support, camaraderie and energy that has come out of this collaboration has made a big difference this year.' 

DAE’s collaboration with De Parade took place from 8 September 2020 until 30 January 2021, and was carried out under strict Covid regulations.

caption: "Pierre Allain, Future Nostalgia\r\n\r\n‘Future nostalgia’ is a collaborative project aiming to produce body extensions and performative signs to encourage festival’s visitors to respect social distancing. Although the\r\n\r\nCovid-19 virus have built barriers between us, a festival will remain a celebration of joy, proximity and affection. So far, the rules related to Covid-19 have been restrictive, but perhaps the 1.5-metre between each individual can be a space to fill rather than a space to be afraid of?"

caption: "Alexandra Koutsaftis, Sense of Intimacy\r\n\r\nInspired by the pandemic circumstances, ‘Sense of Intimacy’ is a performance presented through a chat-room stage-design, focusing on exploring the personal sense of intimacy. Each individual is guided through their own experience, supported by online mediums, giving room for imagination and anonymity, a safe space where the spectator can decide on what to show, tell and think."

caption: "Dongwook Jang, De-Parade\r\n\r\nKeeping a 1.5-meter distance is an important part of preventing the spread of Covid-19. However, De Parade is a location with a high density of people - that is what makes it so much fun, but sadly not Covid-safe. Could there be a way to make people want to keep their distance and enjoy the festival at the same time? ‘De-Parade’ is an app allowing people to enjoyably and voluntarily keep a Covid-safe distance at the festival."

caption: "Emma Lijdsman, Bursting Bubbles\r\n\r\n‘Bursting Bubbles’ proposes De Parade a different way of communicating with the intent to disrupt the state of isolation through an interactive installation that consists of several small self-contained stations spread out over a terrain. Creating an interaction between the different bubbles and thus between the many micro communities that exist within Parade, to overcome solitude in times where spontaneous meetings seem like the ‘old reality’."

caption: "Eva Jagerman, City nomad\r\n\r\nLooking at De Parade, the festival has similarities compared to the early nomadic culture. The aim of ‘City nomad’ is to maintain a nomadic culture that the Parade represents in these changing times, by creating a space for the visitor to experience a nomadic feeling at the Parade festival. In the shape of a multifunctional blanket that can be used as well as a tarp, hammock, poncho, pillow and a bag. At the same time, the blanket functions as a measurement tool to create a barrier for a safe distance respecting the 1.5-meter distance policy."

caption: "Aurélie Defez, online.theatre\r\n\r\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, theatres were the first public places to be closed. ‘online.theatre’ explores the possibilities that internet can offer to reach new audiences, without losing the relation with the audience, which is essential for performers. Emotions of the audience are transformed into data using facial recognition, which influences the digital setting of the performer: the brightness of the light, the background, the sound or a face filter. In this setting, the performer is experiencing a type of setting in which technology becomes the mediator between one and the other."

caption: "Linda Huijbers, Huidhonger\r\n\r\nThe past year has shown us how human touch is vital. We are in need; our skin is hungry for contact and connection with others. In these present circumstances, social distancing and everyday actions like washing hands are essential. These simple hygiene standards helped me to create an installation that enables us to join hands. The installation allows and creates a moment between two people in times of social distancing, where they wash each other’s hands. It is an emotionally charged concept with a highly topical message that after these challenging times, will remain essential, to connect, to join hands."

caption: "Filips Staņislavskis, Rites of Passage\r\n\r\n‘Rites of passage’ is an attempt to ritualize the new habits of the 1.5 m society. The rituals are designed to strip individuals of their original identities and through anonymity and prescribed behaviour - prepare them for new roles. This year the visitors will be met with safety regulations masquerading as rituals, and witness performances that are engaging with the themes of transformation, ritual, magic, mystery, as well as shows that enable sympathetic and regenerative experiences."

The designers want to let the visitors experience old and new washing methods themselves. In this way, the visitor will learn to read and understand their own hands: by reading the missing spots made visible by coloured soap."

This project aims to empower children’s creativity within cultural environments. Theatre festival De Parade is a perfect ground to open up dialogues and experiment ideas on how cultural events can still take place regardless the restrictions which have been established these days. ‘Olifantenpaadje’ proposes different workshops to empower the children’s creativity and give their voice on societal challenges."
