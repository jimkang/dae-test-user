# DAE CULTURE, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVITY ACTION POINTS, 2021

Since 2019, Design Academy Eindhoven has been focused on [updating its approach to education](https://designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/inclusivity-and-culture/inclusivity-and-culture-updates) and its internal structures in response to the changing demands of its student body and to reflect significant shifts in wider society. 

In April 2021, DAE’s Executive Board published the findings of an [independent report into the culture at school](https://designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/inclusivity-and-culture/assessment-of-social-safety-and-culture-2021), commissioned in response to criticism on social media relating to DAE and art and design education and institutions in the Netherlands. 

These two processes have helped shape a number of action points. Some of these have already been completed, some are currently in the process of being addressed, and some are not yet initiated but will be in the coming months. The end goal is a significant structural change across many facets of the Academy, including student assessments, teacher training, care and internal accountability. 

DAE’s editorial team has produced this summary to help the DAE community understand where we are and where we hope to go next.

## What we have done so far

→Launched an [Open Call for new BA Studio Leaders](https://designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/jobs/open-call--proposals-for-new-bachelor-studios), aimed at opening up the Academy to a wider range of ideas and viewpoints
→Introduced regular, informal meetings between the Executive Board and the DAE community, including student conversations, lesson visits and visits to the private studios of Heads and Studio Leaders
→Commissioned Bezemer & Schubad to [research the overall culture at DAE](https://designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/inclusivity-and-culture/assessment-of-social-safety-and-culture-2021) and shared the results with staff, educators and students through meetings, emails and via the website 
→Commissioned Bezemer & Schubad to [investigate the culture within Studio Identity](https://designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/inclusivity-and-culture/studio-identity-investigation-qanda), published a summary of the findings and held discussions with current students and studio leadership to determine next steps 
→Overhauled [participation within DAE](https://designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/dae/participation) to create new systems where students, educators and staff can have a clear seat at the table in decision making and shaping the curriculum
→Introduced [new professorships](https://designacademy.nl/p/research-and-debate/professorships) to strengthen research at the Academy, including a dedicated professorship for Diversity and Inclusivity
→Overhauled the complaints procedure and structure of reporting with confidential counsellors and advisors
→Repositioned DAE's management team to better reflect the needs and structure of the school
→Introduced a new Teachers' Week, with training, lectures and events to support teacher development
→Transformed the structure of the BA programme, introducing a flexible studio system with more self-directed teaching from the student's perspective and more participation between students, teachers and staff
→Clarified the organisational structure and communicated this via a new [organogram](https://designacademyeindhoven.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/MediaforWebsite/ERpXMAiVQwFBrC95ras6s7QBfz4XKWJDKZmWXM656O5phw?e=jHLwkH).
 
## Currently in progress

→Development of a comprehensive diversity and inclusivity training programme, with a series of courses for teachers and staff
→A Social Justice Conference to take place during Dutch Design Week, organised by the Social Justice Lab
→Creation of a new vision and mission plan, outlining DAE’s vision for the ‘education of the future’, formed in collaboration with a large group of current students, tutors, heads and staff
→Reassessment of current hiring practices, with a particular focus on identifying any barriers towards inclusivity and diversity
→An international design research festival to take place in Spring 2022, organised around the themes explored through the three DAE professorships
→Rollout of new curriculum across BA and MA programmes, shaping courses to reflect the ongoing development of education at DAE
→Creating a new DAE Code of Conduct, which all students and staff will have to sign as part of their contract/enrolment
→Ongoing [cooperation between the Anti-Racist Committee, the student council and the Executive Board](https://designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/inclusivity-and-culture/joint-communication-updates) to identify opportunities for change and action
→The launch of the new Social Justice Lab led by Professor Praveen Sewgobind for further debate and discussion (an [Open Call has been issued](https://designacademy.nl/p/research-and-debate/professorships/social-justice-lab-open-call) and applications are being processed)
→Setting up further training courses in didactic skills for teachers
→Commissioning further research by Bezemer & Schubad into specific cases on inappropriate behaviour highlighted in their previous study

## Still to come

→Consultation with current freelancers working at DAE to explore issues and ideas around teaching, training, employment, security and support and develop a Statue of Freelancers
→The structure for student assessment and feedback will be reviewed as part of DAE’s educational development process. The goal is a completely new system by the beginning of the 2022 academic year 
→A new contact point for alumni within DAE, with a clear line of reporting for any issues, as well as regular, improved alumni communications
→Create a clear guide for anyone with a complaint, outlining the steps they can take within DAE and who they can contact
→Unlock the interpretation of each role within the organisation related to care and reporting (coordinators, care, student counsellor, confidants, etc.) and communicate their functions clearly
→Work with Bezemer & Schubad to create an appropriate structure to act on any further findings that come out of the ongoing research around specific alleged inappropriate behaviour reported in the overall culture findings
→Integrate any further action points identified by the Bezemer & Schubad reports into the structure of DAE’s organisation and identifying priorities and processes to do this

## Your input

The Executive Board is open to feedback on all elements of the above plan and enthusiastically welcomes any and all ideas towards improving the safety and experience of all members of the DAE community. Contact them at <ExecutiveBoard@designacademy.nl>.
