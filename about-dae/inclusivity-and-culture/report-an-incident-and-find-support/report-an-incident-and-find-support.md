# HOW TO REPORT AN INCIDENT, FIND SUPPORT AND SEEK ADVICE AT DAE

## If you want to report an incident or need support, there are a number of different resources available to members of the DAE community.

Every member of our community has a right to feel safe at DAE. It is of utmost importance that everyone has access to clear and effective ways to report inappropriate actions of any kind. This makes it possible for us to address the issue. It is also important to know where you can turn for advice and support. The resources outlined below are available to students and staff who wish to report a complaint, incident or concern or to find help, advice and support.

## Internal

For students, the student counsellor and student mentor can both provide support and guidance for a wide range of different circumstances, including reporting any incidents affecting or involving a member of the DAE community. Olga Pullens (student counsellor) and Mona Smits (Mentor BA) can both be contacted directly via their DAE email and can discuss issues in confidence. You can find out more about [how to contact them and what they can help with here](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/student-life/care).

Both students and staff can contact DAE's confidential counsellor Yolande Hezemans. Discussions with the confidential counsellor are confidential and anonymous. You can find out more about the confidential counsellor and [how to contact her by phone or email here](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/student-life/confidential-counsellor).

Issues and concerns can also be shared directly with the Executive Board via email: <ExecutiveBoard@designacademy.nl>

## Independent

If you feel more comfortable discussing your concerns with an external party who is not an employee of the Design Academy Eindhoven, you can contact Elly Pingen. Pingen is anÂ external consultant and confidential counsellor and is available for all students and staff for any issues related to your wellbeing. You can find out more about [how to contact her here](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/student-life/confidential-counsellor). 

Students and staff can also contact Mores, an independent disclosure office for reporting undesirable behaviour in the performing arts, film and television sectors, art education and museums. Mores is completely independent from DAE and provides certified confidential advisors that can listen to individual concerns or complaints and offer advice. They work with ethologists and lawyers if necessary. [https://mores.online]
