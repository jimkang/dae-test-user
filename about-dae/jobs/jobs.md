## TEACHING TEAM AT DAE

DAE's teaching team is a fundamental part of its identity. Since the 1980s, the school has worked with designers and industry experts who teach at DAE for one or two days per week, alongside running their own practice or business.

A teaching team of non-academic professionals reinforces the school's vital relationship between industry and education. All of the current Bachelor studios and Master labs are led by well-known designers, researchers and curators, who reflect the wide range of possibilities of a career in or around design. They serve as role models for DAE's students and determine the design vision of their own studio or lab, within the school's educational framework. They create their own teaching teams, with designers, architects, industry experts, philosophers, etc. from their own professional network.
