# SALONE DEL MOBILE 2013

DESIGN ACADEMY EINDHOVEN PRESENTS: LINKING PROCESS
CURATED BY MIRIAM VAN DER LUBBE

This year’s exhibition of Design Academy Eindhoven at Salone del Mobile will take place at Lambrate.

‘Linking Process’ will be curated by Miriam van der Lubbe showing a unique selection of work by recently graduated bachelors and masters.

After two editions at ‘Studio Zeta’ the academy’s annual exhibition during Salone del Mobile 9-14 April will be moving to a new location: the LAP-building in the Lambrate area (Lambretto Art Project). At this venue curator Van der Lubbe will create a ‘design story’ with the academy’s graduate projects as the key figures.

Besides the academy five other parties will exhibit their projects at LAP:
Z33 - House for contemporary art, HAN Gallery, Chi ha paura...?, Valerie Traan gallery and Aldo Bakker. Consequently, LAP will be a Design Hub for all visitors of Ventura Lambrate.
