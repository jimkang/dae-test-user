# 1.5 Meter! How?
## From on September 2020 until February 2021, students from DAE and De Parade will be working together on the question ‘1.5 Meter! How?’.

---

The collaboration between Studio Urgencies (the DAE bachelor department, led by art director and artist Irene Fortuyn) and De Parade will focus on the consequences of the 1.5-meter society that has become a new reality due to the Covid-19 virus. What does this mean for De Parade? What does this mean for the organization of theatre performances, visitor flows, mobility and accessibility in and to the city, bicycle parking, waiting for performances, food and drink, the camping site, the shape of the tents, the cycle and logistics of building and dismantling, the comings and goings of actors and employees, etc.? On September 8, a group of app. 20 students met with the organisation of De Parade in Amsterdam – with respect to the 1.5 meter – to dive in the world of the performance arts.
