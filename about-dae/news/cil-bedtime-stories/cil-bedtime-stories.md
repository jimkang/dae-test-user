# CIL Bedtime Stories

Please join our first year students from our MA ‘The Critical Inquiry Lab’ with their ‘Bedtime Stories’ live on their Instagram page @thecriticalinquirylab.

Three times a week around 9pm guests will share stories about something they care about. The aim is to weave a new community during these days of isolation and hopefully create some intimate moments that are now lost. They hope to spark curiosity as well as inspiration or poetic moments.

Former head Tamar Shafrir and current head Saskia van Stein are amongst the bedtime guests.

If you are interested, join them on @thecriticalinquirylab to find who their guests are and what the exact schedule is.
