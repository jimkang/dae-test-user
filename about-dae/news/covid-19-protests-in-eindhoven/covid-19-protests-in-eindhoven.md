## Protests in Eindhoven - DAE building will close at 4pm today!
25 January 2021

Dear DAE community,

The DAE building will close at 4pm today. We have just received information suggesting that events that took place on Sunday in Eindhoven could be repeated this afternoon or this evening, and must urge all students and staff to stay away from the centre and to get home as soon as possible if you are in the Academy building.

On Sunday, Eindhoven witnessed violent and destructive behaviour around the station and the city centre by a group of people who claimed to be protesting against the government’s Covid-19 restrictions.

We absolutely and without question support the right to protest peacefully, a fundamental human right that must be protected. But we can never condone this kind of shocking behaviour. What happened on Sunday amounted in many cases to little more than looting. When so many are struggling, these actions have added an unnecessary burden and sense of insecurity for people in Eindhoven.

At DAE, the safety of our students, staff, and educators is always our number one priority. The Mayor has stated that he expects more incidents of this nature, so we are taking action to protect our community.

## Accessing the Academy

From today, there will be an increased security presence at the entrance to DAE. The student entrance will remain the main point of access – it is also the emergency exit so it must remain accessible. However, the security team is briefed to take swift action to secure the entrance if there are signs of a similar event.

If you need to come into the Academy building, please ensure you have your ID and – if applicable – your access fob.

If an event occurs in the town centre or around the main railway station, anyone using the building is advised to make their way through the Lichtplein behind the Academy away from the centre and to the Strijp S train station instead of the main station.

## Workshops and workspaces

It is important that students with end-terms and final exams who need and want to access these spaces can do so. This is why we have made significant efforts to keep these spaces open as much as we can, given the current restrictions. We will not change this as a result of the recent actions.

Those who are allowed to come into the Academy building to use the workshops and workspaces should check the news before travelling and communicate with their tutors if there are any concerns.

Anyone who feels unsafe accessing the workshops and workspaces due to Sunday’s event should contact their tutors and with the student counsellor Olga Pullens: olga.pullens@designacademy.nl.

All of the educators want to make sure you are properly supported during this period and alleviate any unnecessary stress if possible.

## VVV building

Rioters attempted to break into the VVV building in front of Eindhoven station, which has been hosting workspaces for current third-year Minor students. Although they didn’t get in, they threw stones through the windows. Luckily, no one was hurt, and the windows were made from security glass, so the damage is not as significant as it might have been. The building is currently being cleaned, and students can go in via the main entrance to retrieve their belongings. There will be no further teaching in this space until further notice.

Being in the heart of the city has always been something we have celebrated at DAE. Although our community is international, we consider ourselves part of what makes Eindhoven a vibrant, interesting and exciting city to be in. It is incredibly sad that these events have affected this, even if it is only temporary.

Thank you all for your solidarity and patience in adapting to the Covid-19 regulations and respecting the collective effort of those around you. We hope to be in touch again soon with some more positive news.

Best wishes,
The Executive Board,
Joseph Grima and Raf de Keninck

## Unrest in Eindhoven and the Netherlands 
27 January 2021

Dear DAE community,

In view of the uncertain situation caused by the riots in Eindhoven and other cities in the Netherlands, the DAE building will close at 16:30 for the remainder of this week. We’re sorry that we have had to take this decision as a precaution, but of course, safety comes first.

The municipality reported on Tuesday evening that Eindhoven has immediately been declared as a security risk area due to the continuing unrest after the introduction of the curfew. These measures are in force until 9 February. This means that police officers may conduct preventative searches in this area in the coming period.

We are aware that this situation might affect students with upcoming end-terms, so these students will be contacted by the bachelor educational desk. Efforts are being made to handle this situation with care, and any changes will be communicated.

For next week, the Risk Management Team will be meeting this weekend to make further decisions – we hope that the situation will have calmed down by then.

To conclude with some positive news, we’re happy to inform you that all BA graduates who took their exam yesterday passed, of which one graduated Cum Laude!

Best wishes, 
Executive Board
Joseph Grima and Raf De Keninck

## The DAE building will close at 18:30 from Monday 1 February 2021
29 January 2021

Dear DAE community,

It seems that the Netherlands become a little more resilient without new protests in Eindhoven or elsewhere. Therefore, we are glad to announce that from Monday 1 February, the Academy will return to the initial closing time of 18:30 in this period of Covid curfew.

We will keep a close eye on the situation the upcoming weekend and revise this decision immediately if events get worse again. The safety of students, tutors and staff stays our priority. Therefore, please keep checking the news and your emails. But without further notice, DAE will close at 18:30 from next Monday.

Best wishes,
Executive Board
Joseph Grima and Raf De Keninck

*The workshops and work spaces will close Monday -Thursday at 18:00, Friday at 17:30.
