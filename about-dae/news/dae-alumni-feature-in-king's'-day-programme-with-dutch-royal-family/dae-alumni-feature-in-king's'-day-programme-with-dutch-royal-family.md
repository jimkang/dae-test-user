# DAE ALUMNI FEATURE IN KING'S DAY PROGRAMME WITH DUTCH ROYAL FAMILY

---

## DAE alumni featured in a unique national TV broadcast from Eindhoven as part of King’s Day 2021

---

Simon Dogger (BA 2017) and Laura Hoek (BA 2020) presented their projects to the Netherlands’ King Wilem-Alexander and Queen Máxima, who chose to spend the annual King’s Day festival in Eindhoven. Due to Covid-19, the couple were hosted at Brainport Eindhoven for a Covid-proof programme, which included a TV broadcast by NPO. The participants sat on [chairs designed by DAE alumnus, Sander Mulder](https://www.sandermulder.com/triple.html).

During the broadcast, Dogger discussed his [tools aimed at increasing the quality of life of visually impaired people](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/graduation-show/graduation-projects/simon-dogger), while Hoek presented [Klankbord](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/graduation-show/graduation-projects/laura-hoek), a project that collects public opinion on important questions in a way that gives a qualitative insight beyond numbers and statistics. 

Florian de Vries, another DAE alumnus, also presented the Eindhoven Panorama, a 360 collage of Eindhoven to celebrate 100 years of Eindhoven created in collaboration with the Eindhoven Museum.

All participants tested negative for Covid-19 before taking part in the show.

Marijn van der Poll, a current tutor at DAE and an alumnus of the school, was creative project leader for the city's King’s Day programme on behalf of the Eindhoven municipality.

DAE alumni also took part in a number of King’s Day events. A selection of 2020’s BA graduates were part of the [Impromptu Mini Graduation Show #2 organised by design venue Kazerne](https://kazerne.com/en/design/impromptu-mini-graduation-show/), an initiative spearheaded by DAE alumnus Annemoon Geurts. They included Olga Flor, Leanne van Hees, Ieva Jakusa, Gavin Jones, Flora Lechner, Phillipp Pals, Marie Panken, Giulia Pompilj, Bram de Vos and Zavier Wong.

Food designer Annelies Hermsen (BA 2005) hosted [a talk on food trends and created a special takeaway meal](https://www.koningsdageindhoven.nl/programma/food-design) together with Dick Middelweerd as part of Eindhoven’s official King’s Day programme. 

The Designer Lottery, a fundraiser presented by DAE alumni Willem van Hooff and Job van den Berg, also featured design prizes by even more alumni, including Nacho Carbonell, Jelle Mastenbroek, Diego Faivre, Piere Castignola, Ester Jongsma, Sam van Gurp, Niels Hoebers, Remy van Zandbergen, Fleur Hulleman, Harm van den Nieuwenhof and Elke van den Berg.
