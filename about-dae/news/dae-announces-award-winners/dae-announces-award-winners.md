# DESIGN ACADEMY EINDHOVEN ANNOUNCES AWARD WINNERS
 
After this year’s Master and Bachelor graduations, which took place at the end of summer due to COVID-19, a jury of experts convened at Design Academy Eindhoven to judge the nominees for the Gijs Bakker, René Smeets and Melkweg Awards 2020. The jury was impressed by the quality of all the projects and it unanimously selected Meghan Clarke (MA Contextual Design), Mathijs van Gageldonk (BA Public Private) and Ignacio Subías Albert (BA Leisure) as this years winners. The winners received a sum of € 2,000 and a trophy designed by DAE alumna Audrey Large during the Graduation Show and Award Ceremony.
The COVID-19 pandemic had a deep impact on this year’s graduation work. Education moved online in March and most of the international students returned home. Working from home influenced their projects to a great degree, as can be seen in many of the nominated projects. The curriculum challenges students to bring their background and personal histories into their work, which, as a result of COVID-19, acquired a completely new dimension.

## GIJS BAKKER AWARD 2020, MA
The Gijs Bakker Award is presented to an outstanding Master graduate whose thesis research and design project demonstrate outstanding skill and imagination, tenacity and originality, personality and relevance to the profession and the outside world. These criteria reflect the foundations of the Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE) Master programme, which was initiated by designer Gijs Bakker.
 
The jury for the Gijs Bakker Award 2020 consisted of Lucas Evers (head of programme, Waag), Gijs Frieling (artist and senior art advisor to the Chief Government Architect) and Hicham Khalidi (director Jan van Eyck Academie, Maastricht). DAE was pleased with the jury composition because its expertise encompasses design, technology, society and art, precisely the fields in which the Master students operate.

** Winner: Meghan Clarke, This Work of Body/ This Body of Work ** 
In elaborating on its choice, the jury comments: “It could so happen that one might walk right past Meghan Clarke’s presentation. [This Work of Body/ This Body of Work](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/graduation-show/graduation-projects/meghan-clarke) seems rather unassuming. Clarke has taken something as mundane as re-used and discarded curtains from her family home and deconstructed them. Thread by thread she took them apart, thousands of threads, and one by one she knotted these threads together, counting her act in knots. And with this new bobbin of thread she created – knitted and knotted – a new piece, a cross between a curtain and a net. We become witnesses to her repetitive, non-productive productivity. Minutes have turned to hours, hours have turned to days, counting the knots. It is by way of this deconstruction that she makes time visible. In a society where all energy is put into growth, it is radical to think in cycles, to value repetition, and work itself, and to put as much energy and beauty into taking something apart. She has taken her space, her time and her freedom, and created this drastic, profound, and ultimately astonishing work.”

Nominees
A total of eight projects were nominated from the four Masters Departments. The other nominees were ‘Cinzia Bongino with ‘The Weapons’ Reputation’, Sergi Casero Nieto with ‘The Pact of Forgetting’, Mechteld Jungerius with ‘Open Veld’, Žan Kobal with 'Nostalgia for a World That Never Existed’, Coltrane McDowell with ‘Olfactory Biopolitics: Nairobi’, Rachel Morón with ‘Templated Thinking’ and finally Serina Tarkhanian with ‘Co-Healing: An Institutional Reform for Caring With’.

## RENÉ SMEETS & MELKWEG AWARDS 2020, BA
The jury of experts that judged the Bachelor graduation projects nominated for the René Smeets and Melkweg Award 2020 consisted of Gerard Baten (lead designer at DAF Trucks), Mirjam van Coillie (director marketing & innovation, Royal Gazelle), Janice Deul (fashion activist, writer and curator), Mireille Meijs (senior industrial designer, Royal Mosa) and Martijn Paulen (director, Dutch Design Foundation).
 
** Winner René Smeets Award: Mathijs van Gageldonk, Exercise Through Navigation **
The René Smeets Award is presented each year to a Bachelor graduate who attains a high degree of professionalism in both the development of the design process and the final result of the graduation project.

From the jury rapport: “On average we sit for about nine hours a day, and this greatly increases the risk of disease. Several minutes of exercise a day strongly reduces the risk of disease. Mathijs van Gageldonk designed public furniture so everybody can include a few minutes of necessary exercise in their daily routine. Placed in public areas where we all ‘waste’ time waiting for a bus, tram or train, the furniture offers us an opportunity to use this time to our health’s advantage. The furniture is generic and allows for all types of low- and high-impact exercise. A QR code directs the user to online instructions and suggestions. The idea that exercising in public makes everybody uncomfortable is outdated. The jury is impressed with the thorough research and overall design. Not only are the objects well designed and executed, but the whole system behind it is also clever. Furthermore, [this project](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/graduation-show/graduation-projects/mathijs-van-gageldonk) is ready to be implemented. The designs are truly democratic objects, and they remove any obstacles to improving our daily routine with exercise. The strength of this project is that it is so logical you think it already exists.”

Nominees
The six other nominees for the René Smeets Award were Noor Bootsma with ‘The Alliance of Common Waters’, Miya Faßbender with ‘Urban Futures’, Paulien Nabben with ‘Ambara’, Marie Panken with ‘Type of Thought’, Willeke Segers with ‘Reprocessing’, Lola Tual with ‘Compost & Glyphosate’.

** Winner Melkweg Award: Ignacio Subías Albert, ‘Artificial Wasteland’ **
The Melkweg Award is presented each year to a truly unique talent among DAE's Bachelor graduates. The winning graduation project must be both highly original and full of potential.

From the jury report: “Nature versus culture, or rather artificial nature, captured Ignacio Subías Albert’s imagination and inspired his powerful conceptual project ‘[Artificial Wasteland](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/graduation-show/graduation-projects/ignacio-subias-albert-artificial-wasteland)’. Think of the lawn of the White House, the Washington Monument or the Eiffel Tower, all perfect green lawns. Icons of power and control, of human dominance over nature. However, from the perspective of nature, the perfect green lawn is a green desert, an ecologically barren monoculture. Subías Albert argues that the portrayal of nature in the lawn is not accurate. Nature has no clear borders. It isn’t constructed rationally and part of its cycle is decay. All of these characteristics of nature are absent in the lawn. His project transforms our perception by confronting us with our absurd interpretation of nature. And the even more absurd reproduction of nature in 100% plastic: artificial grass. He created a collection of three handmade carpets with three new versions of artificial grass: in decay, with weeds, and with human traces. Here artificial nature tries to represent nature in a truthful manner. The outcome is so convincing that the jury members were Iiterally on their knees inspecting the carpets. What an outstanding project, what visual research, what a beautiful publication, what amazing works!”

Nominees
The other projects nominated for the Melkweg Award 2020 were Anna Dienemann with ‘Bounding Spaces’, Niels Nielsen with ‘Voiceful’, Hattie Parker with ‘The Devil and his Lettuce’, Manuel Pellegrini with ‘The Graduation Project’, Lucas de Ruiter with ‘Bathing in the Cloud’, Elsa Sier with ‘Wired’ and Boey Wang with ‘Immeasurable Range’.

## AWARD DESIGN BY AUDREY LARGE
The new DAE awards are made by designer and alumna Audrey Large. Straddling between art and object design, her practice explores the potential of digital image manipulation processes applied to the design of our material surroundings. On each 3D printed award there are digitally hand drawn initials of the award's name. The intertwining, fluorescent graduation of both colour and shape are created by a dual extrusion process and represent the transition between DAE and the professional life of the graduate that has been endorsed by this award.
