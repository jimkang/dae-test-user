# DAE CELEBRATES 2021'S MASTERS

## On 17 June 2021, Design Academy Eindhoven welcomed the newest generation of Master graduates into its alumni community with a graduation ceremony at the Academy building.

---

Bringing together students, tutors, heads and staff in one physical place for the first time in the academic year, the ceremony was a celebration of the achievements of the MA students in the face of unprecedented challenges.

Joseph Grima, creative director of DAE, expressed his admiration for a cohort of graduates that have not just made the best of the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic but have taken the opportunity to strive towards advancing design and creating better outcomes for themselves and for society. 

“As we find ourselves again being pulled and pushed around the world into the frenetic schedules that we were familiar with before all of this began, I think it’s important that we capture some of the things that we have learned over the last year,” said Grima. “In the hardest of circumstances you have graduated, you have succeeded… but don’t forget everything that came to you over the past year. I’m incredibly excited to see what you will do.”

The ceremony was live-streamed so that family members and friends could watch from around the world, and the heads of the four departments also announced the Cum Laude recipients and the nominees for the Gijs Bakker award, which recognises the best-of-the-best of the MA graduates.

This year’s ceremony marked the departure of Louise Schouwenberg, head of Contextual Design, who announced her plans to step down earlier in the year after more than 20 years of teaching at DAE. Grima paid tribute to Schouwenberg’s lasting influence on generations of students and the school itself. “You have given so much to this school that we have all become part of you in a way and you have become part of us,” he said. “What really matters is people like you who give a piece of yourself, of your life, to make the school what it is. This is something we will never be able to pay back.” 

Schouwenberg said that the work produced by this year’s graduates were a perfect illustration of the approach and standpoint of the Contextual Design department. “A nightmarish pandemic... did not stop you from making impressive speciatlutive narratives, tantalising conversation pieces and poetic, beautiful objects and products based on your artistic talents and genuine engagement with the world around us,” she said. 
 
Awarded both Cum Laude and a nomination for the Gijs Bakker award were Contextual Design graduates Bianca Schick and Bruno Baietto. Through an interactive installation, Schick’s ‘I Lick I Click I Bite I Spit’ explores digital data as a record of affective-charged narratives that actively participate in constructing personal identity. Baietto’s project, ‘Follow The Crumbs That Fall From Your Own’, takes an allegorical approach to explore the possibility of critiquing ideology through design, focusing on bread as a signifier of labour, class, the political, and the religious. 

In total, 10 Contextual Design graduates were awarded Cum Laude. These included Guy Bar-Sinai’s ‘The Virtual Kingdom of Negligible Objects’, a virtual reality space housing different collections of neglected and low-value objects, where functionality takes centre stage and all hierarchies are removed. 

An investigation into the digital realm and its associated desires is furthered by both Anna Resei’s ‘ANTISHAPE’ and Hi Kyung Eun’s ‘Strange Cohabitation’. Resei questions whether the act of creation is what differentiates humans from Artificial Intelligences through a fictional scenario in which a machine analyses human desires and manufactures the corresponding product, until one day it creates seemingly rootless surplus objects. Hi Kyung Eun, on the other hand, explores digital culture and the dichotomies it highlights within our lives, asking what people want from digital interactions and how, in turn, the act of looking becomes data. 

Maren Bang Tondevold’s ‘UNCONTROLLABILITY OR PARANOID PRODUCTION AND PERCEPTION… or you’re so paranoid you probably think this project is about me’ consists of three hypothetical objects and multiple narratives at work to reclaim control of the evaluation process. This narrative of reclamation and inverted critique is also mirrored in Hsin-Min Chan’s ‘To-be-looked-at-ness’, is which Chan created a sculptural dress that functions as a suit of armour, transforming the wearer into an unapproachable, autonomous creature no longer owned or disciplined by the male gaze. 

This choreography of critique, fictional worlds, and materiality connects to Carlos Sfeir Vottero’s ‘La (re)constitución de los Andes’, which draws linguistic, landscape, and semiotic connections between Chile and the Netherlands through magical realism. Ned Kaar also investigated the entanglement of digital technologies and material relations in his project ‘Composites’, creating a furniture collection that blends materials and surfaces together inside domestic typologies. 
 
The graduates of Information Design focused on two extremes over the past year, said department head Joost Grootens. Non-visual aspects of information became an important field of study, with students exploring the potential of other forms of media like sound, alongside a critical approach towards hyper-visuality and the aestheticisation as a strategy against destruction and misinformation. 

Information Design graduates Claire Matthews and Rona David were both awarded Cum Laude and nominated for the Gijs Bakker award. Matthews’ ‘Terminal Prophets’ examines the process of developing and applying an algorithm based on voice and speech data, questioning how technology is shaping the way knowledge and decisions are produced. In ‘All This Fuss Over A Jar Of Pickles?’, David plays with absurdity and meaning, investigating the role of language in design by means of a pickle jar as a metaphor for existence.

Critical Inquiry Lab head Saskia van Stein described the experience of teaching and learning over the past year as a “collaborative survivalism”. Through their artistic research, graduates have questioned ‘what is design as research?’ and ‘what is research as design?’, she said. The department’s nominees for the Gijs Bakker award were Viktória Kaslik and Litty Salas, with Kaslik also being named Cum Laude for her project ‘Legal Remedy’. In this embodied, performative work, she considers the legal system as a human creation, but one which acts upon us in turn: legal codes become internalized and absorbed by the collective body. Salas’ project, ‘Ephemeral Spaces’, explores perceptions of city spaces through both subjective and objective frameworks, thereby opening up possibilities to understand the city beyond its mere physicality.

The incoming head of Social Design Marina Otero introduced the work of this year’s graduates, which “don’t always offer bold solutions, but higher resolutions through which to rethink what society could be.” Benedetta Pompili and Ginevra Petrozzi were nominated for the Gijs Bakker award, and Petrozzi named Cum Laude for the department. In ‘Conversing with Matter’, Pompili conducts a dialogic investigation into craft, industry, and material, focusing upon clay and the reuse of asbestos as a clay filler. This material-based approach is contrasted with Petrozzi’s ‘Digital Esoterism’, which proposes witchcraft as a tool to regain agency over the realm of big data that—operating under surveillance capitalism—predicts and controls the future.

As a whole, the class of 2021 presented a multidisciplinary array of materialities, narratives, methodologies, and critical perspectives to engage with the fields of design and design research. Their projects will be showcased at the Graduation Show 2021 during Dutch Design Week in October.
