# Learning from the past: DAE welcomes the start of a new academic year

## This year’s annual opening event at Design Academy Eindhoven shied away from inspirational mottos, instead reflecting on the challenges of the last two years and looking ahead hopefully to new initiatives and possibilities.

'We do not simply want to go back to how everything was before. We really want to hang onto the things we have learnt and make a treasure out of the experiences that we have come through in the last two years and to bring those back to the Academy,' said Creative Director Joseph Grima.

On 31 August 2021, a hybrid opening celebration took place both online and in-person, opening the doors of the Academy to welcome the new generation of Bachelor and Master first-year students (in four Covid-friendly groups) while familiar faces of returning students, tutors, studio leaders, heads and staff gathered in an online session, greeted by encouraging words from Grima as well as Director of Organisation and Research, Raf De Keninck. 

De Keninck kicked off the reception with promising news of an uninterrupted year ahead: the Ministry of Education has announced that no institution or university in the Netherlands will be forced to close this academic year, despite an expected fourth wave of Covid cases. 

This certainty also helps with the development of various initiatives. De Keninck shared details of a new lecture series, the continuation of Elevator Radio, an inclusivity conference taking place during DAE's upcoming graduation show in October, an international research festival, group agreements for studios, and the development of the Social Justice Lab within the school.

Along with these exciting initiatives, there are also changes to DAE's educational programming, with architect Afaina de Jong starting as the new head of Contextual Design and four new Bachelor studios also launching. 

Curator Martina Muzi leads Studio Technogeographies, using design as a lens to investigate the social, material, technological, and geopolitical condition of our world. Designer Nacho Carbonell leads Studio Do! Make! with emphasis on a tactile approach to design through doing and making. The third studio, Studio Thinking Hands is led by alumni Kiki van Eijk and Joost van Bleiswijk, focusing on student’s intuition and aims to find a balance between thinking and making. The fourth studio will be formally announced soon.

Perhaps the strongest message and greatest reminder, as we head into a new academic year, was that of what makes up the school and the core values of DAE: the student themselves. 'It is not so much what us, the leaders or administrators or the teachers have to give you, it is what each of you have to give each other,' said Grima. 'The most important learning is between you.'
