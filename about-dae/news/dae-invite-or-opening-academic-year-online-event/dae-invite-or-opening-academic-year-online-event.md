# The Executive Board is happy to invite you to the digital opening of theâ€¯ Academic Year 2020/2021.

## This year will have an unusual beginning, against the backdrop of a worldwide pandemic and big changes in the way we all work, teach and learn. It is more important than ever that we find ways to define ourselves as a community and celebrate together. With this in mind, we have found a way to adapt to our annual opening event.

---

Due to strict limitations on group sizes, only a small group of heads, tutors, staff, students and others will be able to attend physically. Since we still want to include as many members of our community to this year's opening as possible, we have organised a livestream so that the entire DAE community can attend virtually. 

Time: 16:00
Date: 03-09-20
Location: You are invited to attend the event digitally! Click here to view the livestream link to this year's Opening Ceremony.
Programme: Raf De Keninck, our Director of Education and Research, will open the year and introduce our key speaker, Dan Hill, who we welcome this year as a visiting professor. The programme will end with an exciting presentation of Design Academy Eindhoven's new visual identity and website by our Creative Director Joseph Grima. The award ceremony for the Jan Lucassen teacher of the year 2019/2020 will be moved from its usual slot in the opening ceremony to another date.
 
We are excited to see you from September onwards!

Kind regards,
The Executive Board
