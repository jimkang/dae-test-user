# DAE LAUNCHES EDITORIAL TEAM

---

## DAE has established an editorial team to support the communication of activities, ideas, and processes taking place within the institution.

Formed at the end of 2020, the core team consists of three former DAE students, with backgrounds in design, journalism, communications, research and curation.   

Colin Keays is a spatial designer and researcher and is responsible for DAE’s social media. Jeannette Petrik is a critical writer and editor and is responsible for DAE’s internal communications and press releases. Anna Winston is a journalist, editor and communications consultant and chief editor of the DAE website. All three have previously been involved in editorial and communications projects at DAE, ranging from the Graduation Show to the Geo–Design exhibitions and the Academy’s Covid-19 response strategy. 

Although each member of the team has a specific responsibility, they plan to act collectively where possible. A mission statement outlining the team’s goals and plans can be read here. <https://www.designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/dae/editorial-team>

Among other objectives, the team aims to aid the Academy’s progress in its ambition to be inclusive and create a supportive and safe culture for students and staff, and set a standard for transparency and communication in design education. The editorial team sits within the wider Communications team, which includes specialists in events, PR and production. 

The team will be in place until April 2020, when its activities will be reviewed and reassessed.
