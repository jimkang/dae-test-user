# DAE LECTURE SERIES 01

We are happy to announce the first event of the DAE Lecture Series of 2020! Next Thursday we are welcoming Thomas Thwaites with his lecture 'After Making a Toaster and Being a Goat'.

Which is more important: Empirical Statistical Facts or Unquestioned Civizational Myths? Thomas Thwaites will reflect upon his remarkable and infamous projects The Toaster Project: Or a Heroic Attempt to Build a Simple Electric Appliance from Scratch and GoatMan: How I Took a Holiday from Being Human. Calling himself a designer ‘of a more speculative sort’ he uses the worldly objects as a means to examine the various ways in which we come to understand information and stories, facts and myths. He investigates the complexities of technological, natural and sociological systems when translated to a human scale, or more specific, to one single human.

How could we begin to rethink our design processes to embrace the interconnected world of the unknown that lies behind the familiar?

When
23.01.2020, doors will open at 19.00 and we will start at 19:30h. The event is closing at 22:00h. 

Where
White Lady Space. Please enter through the official entrance.
