# DAE LECTURE SERIES 03

GIRLS LIKE US, A.ll B.odies C.onspiring

This Thursday March 5 we will host a lecture in the guise of an ABC talking about queer & feminist publishing. We are proud to welcome Jessica Gysel and Katja Mater, two of the editors of ‘Girls Like Us’ Magazine. In their lecture titled ‘A.ll B.odies C.onspiring’ they use quotes and excerpts from all issues as a base, with added images from the magazine, events, exhibitions, book fairs and other activities we were involved in, we explore what it means to make a queer and feminist magazine today.

The lecture will take place on 05.03.2020, doors will open at 19.00 and it will start at 19:30h at Design Academy First Floor. Please enter from the official door next to the Public Library and the escalator.

The DAE Lecture Series are open to public; We kindly ask you to RSVP — please bring your ticket via your phone.

Please note that the workshops will be closing at 21:00h as we are serving alcoholic beverages. The event is closing at 22:00h. Please note that it is not possible to enter the rest of the floors after — please take all your belongings with you!
