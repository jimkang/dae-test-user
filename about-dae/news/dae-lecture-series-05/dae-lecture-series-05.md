# DAE LECTURE SERIES 05

This lecture was cancelled

We are happy to announce the fifth DAE Lecture Series of 2020 which will be hosted live on our Instagram feed @designacademyeindhoven. Next Wednesday June 3 we will welcome 'common-interest' with their lecture 'Design Research as Activism'. Pete Fung, one of the members of our DAE Lecture Committee will host the online lecture.

Through unpacking their non-profit practice, common-interest decodes how design, on one hand, can be used as a framework to critically examine the power structure and the constructedness of our world; and on other other hand, as a medium for counteraction against such structural inequalities.

Co-founded by Nina Paim and Corinne Gisel, common-interest is a non-profit design research practice, operating at the intersection of knowledge production, exchange, and mediation.

When
June 3, starting from 19:30 CET at @designacademeindhoven Instagram
