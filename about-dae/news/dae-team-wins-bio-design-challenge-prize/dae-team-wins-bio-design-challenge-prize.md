# DAE STUDENT TEAM WINS BIO DESIGN CHALLENGE PRIZE

---

A trio of DAE graduates and students have scooped the Outstanding Presentation Prize in the annual [Bio Design Challenge](https://biodesignchallenge.org/) (BDC), which includes entries from more than 51 international design and architecture schools. 

Manuel Steitz, Coltrane McDowell and Serina Tarkhanian—all graduates or current students on the Social Design MA—won with their project [Dirty Playground](https://biodesignchallenge.org/designacademy-eindhoven-2021), which deals with ideas of play and probiotic design for public space. 

The BDC was created to challenge high school and university students to explore future applications of emerging biotechnologies. 'There is no such thing as waste in biological systems, so it offers both new and ancient solutions to sustainability,' explained the organisation.  

The challenge holds a week-long summit each June, where participants present their projects to a judging panel with individuals from industry, the arts and academia, as well as to the public. 

Dirty Playground was a finalist for the grand prize, along with the Bacterial Skin Project by fellow Social Design student Josephine de Fijter, which uses bacterial engineered tissue as a carrier for probiotic skincare. 

Steitz, McDowell and Tarkhanian were awarded the BDC's Outstanding Presentation Prize in recognition of their exceptional visual renderings and models, and for the delivery of an outstanding presentation during the summit.

The Social Design students’ participation in the challenge took place under the guidance of DAE tutors Maartje Dros and Eric Klarenbeek. 'The whole trajectory and input given by all was very intensive and collaborative, and because of this tough and almost impossible to choose the winner. We are very happy with the outcome,' said Dros. 

The Dirty Playground team will present their award-winning project at the Media Architecture Biennale in Amsterdam as part of the roundtable [More-Than-Human Intelligence: Bio-Mediated Architecture](https://mab20.mediaarchitecture.org/events/more-than-human-intelligence-bio-mediated-architectures/?origin=event) on 30 June 2021.

## About the projects

Dirty Playground 

Designers: Manuel Steitz, Coltrane McDowell, and Serina Tarkhanian 
 
Dirty Playground positions play as a multispecies activity that unravels over time positioning probiotic design for public space. It suggests using ecological succession as a framework for multi-generational use. Through the process of ecological succession, the playground's soil microbiome over time resembles the richness and biodiversity of a mature forest.  
 
The project follows four key phases: The first is a process of remediation in the form of a swamp park; using oxygen rich groundwater to increase surface area for bacteria to digest contaminants. Second, the transplanting of an ecologically rich soil sample from existing forest to the remediated soil. Third, a messy meadow, a layer of perennial flowers that makes way for a young forest. The last phase is a healthy robust forest which offers health benefits to the people that come to play, and enriches and strengthens our urban soil microbiomes. 
 
At each stage, the process of succession is coupled with elements of play in the form of rammed earth structures. The communities that directly benefit from the area have an active role in the entire process. This in turn enables processes of microbial exchange across species, strengthening our collective microbiomes.  
 
Dirty Playground signals a shift in which longer natural processes such as succession need to be addressed as a crucial element of urban design. Globally biodiversity is in decline, with more people moving into urban centres. The need to make our urban spaces ecologically diverse is precinct now more than ever.

Bacterial Skin Carrier:
Bacterial engineered tissue as a carrier for probiotic skincare 

Designer: Josephine de Fijter

The skin functions as a biological barrier and protects the body’s internal organs from the external environment. Its tactile sensors are an important basic human need for including the skin as a tool for interpreting our surroundings. In contrast, we have developed a Western culture of over cleansing, which numbs the functioning of our microbiota. How can we revive the knowledge of the valuable interactions we need with non-human organisms?

Receiving the growing waste stream of the popular beverage product “Kombucha”. Collaborating with four brewers, located both in Germany and The Netherlands, who support me with the knowledge exchange and a continuous resource stream. The Kombucha-derived cellulose is a low-cost and abundant biopolymer. Produced by the Acetobacter bacteria strain and yeast during the fermentation process. Serving as a protective living tissue against unwanted pathogens in the brew. A cellulose biofilm with binding properties that are non-irritating, non-toxic, edible, and biodegradable and skin safe. Making it interesting for skin care application as its water retention and film forming properties are able to mimic the skin structure. Shaping its potential as the interface for the stimulation of cellular biochemical communication. Being a carrier for skin contact applications, to enhance the permeation of the active ingredients through the skin.

We as human bodies need to take our role and be in relation with the ecological system. Only then are we able to maintain the level of biodiversity needed to preserve life on this planet. Our skin is one of the exchange platforms we need to use to build a system of interspecies learning. Adhering our skin’s tactile pressure points with the correct parameters for delivering the efficacy, safety and stability of the active skin care agent(s).
