# FORMAFANTASMA AND SHAHAR LIVNE NAMED DEZEEN DESIGNERS OF THE YEAR

---

## DAE alumni have been awarded the Designer of the Year and Emerging Designer of the Year prizes in the annual Dezeen Awards, which took place online this year due to Covid-19.

---

Formafantasma (Andrea Trimarchi and Simone Farresin) was awarded Designer of the Year. Trimarchi and Farresin created Formafantasma in 2009 after studying on the IM MA at DAE. They taught at the school as part of the BA Man and Well-being course before becoming the founding heads of the Academy’s new [Geo–Design MA](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/masters/geodesign). 

The Dezeen judging panel said that Formafantasma is "a highly articulate studio whose intellectual and ethical ambitions are the driving force behind their truly sophisticated and beautiful work."

Shahar Livne, who graduated from the BA Man & Leisure course in 2017 and also teaches at DAE, was named Emerging Designer of the Year. 

Livne’s work focuses on conceptual material research and design. Examples include a rubber and yarns made from slaughterhouse waste as well as bio-leather made from animal blood, and a project exploring the potential of the Plastisphere of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, which featured in the DAE exhibition [Geo–Design: Junk at the Van Abbe Museum in 2019](https://geodesign.online/). 

The Dezeen jury said that Livne "stretches the limits with very powerful work" and "is a great example of how design is about designing the future, designing how we live and how we can use our voices to communicate to others that there are alternative ways of thinking."
