## Travelling without moving

Design Academy Eindhoven announces a digital exhibition on the complex dynamics of the ongoing pandemic. The online exhibition GEO—DESIGN: COVID-19. Travelling without moving presents transdisciplinary and research-based projects exploring the effects of a global pandemic on the complex mechanisms underpinning late-capitalist society.
Accessible at covid.geodesign.online, the online exhibition unfolds a digital journey through eight independent chapters investigating the complex manifestations of COVID-19. Entirely conceived and produced for the digital realm, the online exhibition collects and interlinks eight original projects by Design Academy Eindhoven alumni developed from June to September 2020.
 
GEO—DESIGN exhibition platform is an ongoing research initiative of Design Academy Eindhoven which approaches design from an investigative perspective, proposing new formats of research into the socio-economic, geographical and geopolitical forces shaping the work of designers today.

## GEO—DESIGN: COVID-19. TRAVELLING WITHOUT MOVING
The world is currently bearing witness to a pandemic – without a doubt, an unexpected historical turning point. At their breaking points, globalised structures of supply chains are suddenly exposed as fragile, relationships of bodies and spaces drastically changed, perspectives on working arrangements unfold while digital systems of control increasingly become visible.
 
From the controversial success of Zoom to the influence of online user interaction on politics, from supply shortages in food packaging industries to approaches of reshoring pharmaceutical production, GEO—DESIGN: COVID-19. Travelling without moving opens up to original readings of an unexpected, immediate reality marked by acceleration, deceleration and creativity.
 
Challenged by unprecedentedly sudden need for digitisation which the design sector is not exempt of, this fourth episode in the ongoing series of exhibitions produced by the GEO—DESIGN exhibition platform presents eight projects with strikingly different approaches to design and research developed by alumni of the Design Academy Eindhoven. Produced for the digital realm, the exhibition pushes the discipline of design to explore individual as well as global contexts through digital languages of coding, app development, video essays and 3D rendering.

Featuring works by Colette Aliman, Noemi Biasetton, Mar Ginot Blanco, Karin Fischnaller, Lauriane Heim, Colin Keays, Felicity Morris, Tamara Orjola, Clara Ormières, Mathilde Philipponnat, Marvin Unger, Vincent Thornhill and Jasper Zehetgruber, the digital exhibition is curated by Martina Muzi and edited by Jeannette Petrik, with graphic identity and web development by Domitille Debret and Giacomo Nanni.
