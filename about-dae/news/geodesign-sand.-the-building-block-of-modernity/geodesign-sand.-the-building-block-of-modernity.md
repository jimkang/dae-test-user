# GEO—DESIGN: Sand. The Building Block of Modernity 

## As the third chapter to emerge from the GEO—DESIGN exhibition platform, GEO—DESIGN: Sand. The Building Block of Modernity features nine original research-based projects that explore sand as one of the most critical elements of our everyday life — from altered to artificial landscapes, from entrepreneurs to multi-national corporations, from historic failures to new frontiers of design.

Whether we recognise it or not, sand is nothing less than the essential building block of modern civilisation. Sand is all around us: in the buildings we inhabit, in the glasses we wear and the silicone chips in our computers and smartphones. After water, sand is the second-most used resource on planet Earth. GEO—DESIGN: Sand. portrays some of the possible applications, materialities, geographies and economies of this global resource, which — far from being unlimited — is running out. 

GEO—DESIGN: Sand. features works by alumni Rawad Baaklini, Soline Bredin, Elissa Brunato, Matteo Dal Lago, Christophe Dichmann, Lucas Dubois, Romain Laval, Tiiu Meiner, Leo Orta, Bich Tran Quang, Anna Diljá Sigurðardóttir, Baiba Soma, Wu Yanjin and Atelier NL. 

The exhibition is curated by Martina Muzi and edited by Jeannette Petrik, with graphic identity developed and produced by Soline Bredin and Lucas Dubois, who are all alumni of Design Academy Eindhoven.
