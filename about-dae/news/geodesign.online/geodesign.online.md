# GEODESIGN.ONLINE 

## Design Academy Eindhoven is happy to announce the online archive of all previous projects of GEO—DESIGN. The GEO—DESIGN Exhibition Platform is an ongoing design research initiative by and for the alumni of Design Academy Eindhoven which approaches design from an investigative perspective, proposing new formats of research into the socio-economic, geographical and geopolitical forces shaping the work of designers today.

---

The GEO—DESIGN Exhibition Platform publishes today an archive of all previous editions. The archive brings together projects from all three episodes of GEO—DESIGN: Alibaba, Junk and Sand and gives the opportunity to delve into references, research, fieldwork, and design processes behind each project. The platform aims to give insight into a project's trajectory, the relation between original starting points and design decisions, and to give the opportunity to learn from the skills and strategies developed. 

The GEO—DESIGN archive can be accessed at geodesign.online and will be a lasting digital resource that will grow with each episode. Created by a team of DAE alumni: edited by Tamar Shafrir, graphic design by Domitille Debret and Giacomo Nanni and curated by Martina Muzi.
