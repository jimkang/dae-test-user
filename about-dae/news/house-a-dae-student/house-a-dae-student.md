# House a DAE student

## Urgent call out for rooms for the next generation of designers

---

Design Academy Eindhoven is issuing an urgent call to alumni and friends of DAE in Eindhoven to help find accommodation for first-year students. 

Like many European cities over the past two decades, Eindhoven has experienced a wave of gentrification. One of the effects of this has been a severe shortage of affordable, rented housing across the city. 

Now, DAE first years face an annual battle to find accommodation when they arrive in Eindhoven. This year, a few DAE students are still struggling with housing even though the academic year is well underway. 

DAE is working with the Eindhoven municipality, housing agencies and other educational institutions across the city to find solutions, but the Academy now needs to ask its community for help for these students in the short term.

Are you able to temporarily house a fresh DAE student? 

Could you help a student find a temporary room in Eindhoven? 

If you can help in any way, please send an email to <housing@designacademy.nl>.
