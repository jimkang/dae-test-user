# Introducing Studio Thinking Hands—an interview with Kiki van Eijk and Joost van Bleiswijk

---

Led by Kiki van Eijk and Joost van Bleiswijk and launching in September 2021, Studio Thinking Hands will become one of the core studios within Design Academy Eindhoven’s BA programme. Each studio has its own vision of design, offering students a unique opportunity to explore and work with different practitioners. 

'We want to teach students to use their intuition as a compass', says Kiki van Eijk, who founded the Eindhoven-based design practice Kiki & Joost with Joost van Bleiswijk after the two met while studying at DAE. They combine a playful approach to design with a hands-on, practical attitude to manufacturing and materiality. 'We are designing to create a better world,' says Joost van Bleiswijk. 'It's not only aesthetics that matter… There's a thin line between craziness and perfection.' 

Focused on the idea of thinking through making, their studio aims to help students find a balance between the two. 'It's important to be inspired by your own creations and to avoid getting stuck behind your computer all the time,’ explains van Bleiswijk. 'It’s much more exciting to see what happens if you grab some material, manipulate it and react to that.'

Jeannette Petrik from DAE’s Editorial Team interviewed the duo to find out more about how they plan to create an educational structure that makes space for idealism, experimentation, practicality and analysis.

→ Jeannette Petrik: How did you envision the combination of thinking and making that is at the heart of the new BA studio?  

Kiki van Eijk: It seems obvious for us to combine the two. Often, there’s an imbalance because practices focus more on thinking or on making. We want to do both.  

Joost van Bleiswijk: Crafts manufacturing is rapidly vanishing, especially in the West. Most jobs are done with machines and the ability to make something with the hands is increasingly rare. We feel that it's important to be inspired by your own creations and to avoid getting stuck behind your computer all the time because then you only think in lines and apply your ideas exclusively to processes like laser cutting and 3D printing. It’s much more exciting to see what happens if you grab some material, manipulate it and react to that.  

KvE: In fact, we design while making, because there are many things to discover in this process. Often, one thing leads to something else. Even the mistakes you make can lead to something very inspiring, which you couldn't have predicted by drawing something up on paper or with a computer. When you train to improvise, there are many new solutions and possibilities that can come out of that.   

JvB: That mentality can be used in a very broad sense, not only for making tangible things. Whatever you make should have a function, whether it is an artistic, philosophical or an aesthetic one, but at the same time, it has to be ‘good’. We are designing to create a better world. It's not only aesthetics that matter.  

There's a thin line between craziness and perfection. If you're too confident you might not have a broad horizon, while if you're not confident enough, you probably won't make anything. We like to say: Head in the clouds with feet on the ground. You have to keep dreaming but you also need a solid base to stand on.  

→ JP: How do you imagine the educational realisation of Studio Thinking Hands? 

KvE: We want to teach students to use their intuition as a compass. Every child has a strong intuition, the trick is to keep training it.  

JvB: And to stay curious and willing to learn. We want to encourage students to use their four or five years of studying to focus on learning and using the time wisely, to make mistakes and experimenting instead of making finished products.  

KvE: Use it to play around as a child but do it in a serious way. We want to counterbalance dreaming and playing with realistic things that are based in the reality of working in different creative fields, in a broad sense. That’s why we value a multidisciplinary set of tutors. In the end, the design world is quite small.  

All of our tutors will have three different personae: the imaginer, dreamer/ thinker and the maker/ designer.  

JvB: The thinker encourages the individual to ask questions and investigate. We hate unfounded claims. We want to see brains, visual and written material, while this shouldn't be a project on its own.  

KvE: The imaginer would be called ‘verbeelder’ in Dutch, which has a slightly different meaning.  

JvB: It’s a more beautiful word, because it describes creating an imaginary image, like visualising in a poetic way. There’s a sensitivity involved which can take others somewhere with their heart and soul, and their eyes.  

KvE: The imaginer could be a scenographer, while the dreamer/ thinker could be a journalist, an artist, a curator, a writer, a filmmaker. And the third persona is the maker/ designer, working from the hands and the mind at the same time.  

JvB: For the maker/ designer, autonomy should be part of their personality. We won’t train students to be anonymous designers, they will be trained to develop a personality as a practitioner.  

KvE: All of the tutors who will join the studio will each have all these three personae, while one will be highlighted more than the other two. For example, we want to include a maker who is more analytical, somebody who considers the impact on the environment. The two of us will teach as well.  

→ JP: Do you imagine students to also have these three characteristics within them?  

JvB: Yes, these personae will be in them already in some way, while they won’t be perfectly balanced. This distribution of interests and skills is what shapes the personality as a practitioner.  

We think that the personae of the thinker and the dreamer support the maker. This means that our focus is not on the thinking, although we see the thinking part as an essential and crucial role in the design process. We want to focus on visual production, which communicates through images, products or services.  

The basic idea of the studio is to get inspired in the making. For us, this means to start working analogously.  

KvE: Even making a website would really start from a different perspective than looking at the outcome first.   

JvB: We do use digital means but, to us, they are no different than a saw or a hammer.  

KvE: They are tools. The computer is often perceived as a safe haven but there's so much more to discover.  

→ JP: On your website, you write that you ‘never follow trends’ and that you’re ‘never in a hurry’, which points towards patience and taking time. Is this your approach to thinking about a sustainable future?  

JvB: We sometimes have to defend our decision not to use only recycled materials but we make non-trendy things which people will, potentially, use for a lifetime. Those items don't get lost because they continue being used.  

KvE: At the same time, it's a logical part of the design process to think about the environmental impact of a design. For us, all of those considerations are part of the total process. We don’t just highlight one aspect.  

We are quite productive and have a Do-It-Yourself mentality, but we actually take a lot of time for things because we are not in a hurry, we just work on several projects at the same time.  

JvB: We want to teach students that if they develop a certain mentality, or, idea in their heads, it will always be there independently of what they’ll be doing. Unconsciously, we continuously soak up information and inspiration. It's not bad to have 20 ideas simmering in the back of your head. Eventually, some will start to float to the top. From there, it takes confidence to make them happen.  

→ JP: How do you envision this process of developing a mentality within the limited time span of a Bachelor degree?  

KvE: We recently visited our previous teachers who are now 70 years old and we discussed that four or five years are short. It's just the start of a learning process and you continue learning all your life. We hope that students will develop a basic kind of design attitude which can be fruitful throughout their careers.  

We won’t educate product designers, graphic designers or any particular discipline, but we’ll be focussing on working methods and mentality.  

JvB: There is no dress code for designers. The more you know and trust yourself in the process of thinking and making, the better. 

KvE: It’s important to discover the colourful personae within you.  

JvB: In that way, we explore a totality. Apart from producing work, it's about designing one’s whole life. You can make of it whatever you want. We really like the Do-it-Yourself mentality that kids have. Take a cardboard box and it's a boat, or a house or whatever—it can be anything because what shapes it is your imagination.
