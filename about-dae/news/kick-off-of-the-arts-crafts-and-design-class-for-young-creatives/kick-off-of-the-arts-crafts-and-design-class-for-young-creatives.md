Development trajectory for young creatives
By means of this structural education provided by professionals working in the arts, children and teenagers can find a pathway towards tertiary education in a creative discipline. At its Noordkade venue, CHV Academy’s well-equipped spaces and studios include a craft foundry, jewelry workshop, photography studio with darkroom, and ceramics workshop with a unique salt kiln.

Kick-Off, Admission and Pilot The first pilot of this programme will launch in the autumn of 2021, and run for six months. Participation in this first pilot is free of charge for all those who are admitted. The pilot starts with private kick-off for the participants on Saturday May 29 led by Kiki van Eijk (designer, CHV Academy ambassador and BA Studio Leader at DAE) and Pierre Cops (visual and graphic artist) – consists of a workshop and a short motivational conversation.
