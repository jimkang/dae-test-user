# LOUISE SCHOUWENBERG STANDS DOWN AFTER MORE THAN 20 YEARS AT DAE

---

## In June 2021, Louise Schouwenberg, current Head of the master's department Contextual Design will leave Design Academy Eindhoven after more than twenty years.

---

From the emergence of conceptual Dutch design, through its evolution into collectible design, to the swing back to the more critical and research-based practice that has given rise to the current cultural and auto-ethnographic turn – Louise Schouwenberg has developed her educational approach alongside her observations of the design landscape. As one of the most influential educators in the field, her work at the Academy has left an indelible mark both on the field and on the school - as well as on the professional lives of her countless alumni.

Louise Schouwenberg leaves us with a legacy of Contextual Design, which she describes in an e-mail to the DAE community announcing her departure as follows: “The programme’s philosophy aims at trying to estrange students from the familiar and distance them from conventional and pretentious answers. We offer boundless freedom to the imagination, but also awareness of the need to take responsibility for the whole narrative that implicitly hides in each design proposal. This way of working is no less than a risky affair, as it combines a loss of certainties and the ambition to (re)define what genuine authorship means in the realm of cultural production.“

While we are saddened to see Louise Schouwenberg leave, we look back at the changing landscapes of the design world she has witnessed and actively engaged in as an educator, writer and theorist over the course of over twenty years.

The Design Academy Eindhoven community, students, staff and alumni are immensely indebted to Louise for her contribution over these two decades, and wish her all the best.

## LOUISE IN CONVERSATION WITH NADINE BOTHA

---

For the occasion of her leaving, Schouwenberg reflects on her time at Design Academy and the evolution of the design discipline in an interview with Nadine Botha.

---

## “Design is not about isolated objects, it’s about the relationships it enables. Design reflects the times, how people live and work, it reflects who we are as human beings; it envisions who we can be.”

---

“I wanted to create an alternative approach to design and strengthen the students’ imagination”, says outgoing head of the Contextual Design Master’s [Louise Schouwenberg](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/community/louise-schouwenberg), who has pioneered a field against a backdrop of some of the most significant shifts in the Design Academy, and the design world. From the emergence of conceptual Dutch design, through its evolution into collectible design and celebrity, to the swing back to the more critical and research-based design that has given rise to the cultural and auto-ethnographic turn now observable. She reflects on her time at Design Academy with Nadine Botha.

---

*Nadine Botha: You started as a tutor at Design Academy last century, and became head of the Contextual Design Master’s department 10 years ago. Both the school and design have changed so much during those years. What were your expectations when you started?*

*Louise Schouwenberg:* I’ve always experienced a love-hate relationship with the field. Coming from a background in fine art and philosophy, I was wary of the superficial market-driven approach of the design field that seemed to promote that what matters most in life is looks and how you define yourself through consumer objects. At the same time, I was aware of the fact that design is obviously one of the most important cultural domains, as it has such an impact on our daily lives. On the one hand it’s so problematic in its frivolous concern for novelty and sales, and yet we are inevitably living in a world that is totally designed, and composed of things that people have made. Design shapes who we are as human beings. It requires creatives who base their practice on genuine engagement with the world in which they live, and the guts to ignore the field’s conventions.

---

*NB: You started in the design world just at the moment when it started to become more self-aware of itself, and when design education became more academic. How has design education changed since you started?*

*LS:* I started my career at DAE’s Bachelor department Man and Living, where the focus was on the creation of products. At the time Droog design had recognized and encouraged  a turn from industrial design towards self-initiated conceptual designs among young Dutch designers. Droog’s co-owner, Gijs Bakker, who was then head of the department, wanted me to offer philosophy lessons. From quite early we realised that teaching designers theory didn’t lead to anything unless it was immediately linked with praxis, and this connection would become my main aim in education. 

At first, I embraced the conceptual approach wholeheartedly, it has definitely brought a lot. But soon I also realised that this approach too often led to misguided, easily readable and moralistic jokes. This was when I started developing my own views on design. Design is not about isolated objects, it’s about the relationships it enables. Design reflects the times, how people live and work, it reflects who we are as human beings; it envisions who we can be. It thus requires a holistic view on both life and the impact design can have on people’s lives and the world at large. 

In 2006 I started tutoring at the Masters. As in all other Master departments throughout the world, ‘research’ was one of the distinctive characteristics. However, what distinguished the Design Academy is that it had established a system in which it invited innovators in the field, such as Gijs Bakker and Ulf Moritz, to head the departments. Not bogged down by administration, they could fully focus their attention on creating a distinct view on design. The tutors, in turn, were also chosen because of their professional reputation and career, besides incidentally working at DAE. Until this day I consider this a very valuable strategy, as it ensures that an academy stays grounded in what happens in the world, and stays ahead of developments. 

In 2010 I became head of the MA Contextual Design and gradually shaped the department’s philosophy and approach. In line with my previous considerations, I decided to strengthen both reflection (theoretical research, philosophy) and making (experimenting with materials, visuals), as well as their intertwinement. Ever since the start, the cultural background, personal interests and artistic talents of each individual student would become the fertile grounds from which projects in this department start.

While it took some time to win over design students to writing and theory, we now see many of the best designers are also good writers. Good writing comes down to having something to say, whereas the craftsmanship of writing can be learned through training. Recently, we have also begun facilitating more filmmaking, animation and drawing as media with which to express research and express design’s relatedness to the surrounding world. These have particularly taken off in the current Covid-19 restrictions.

---

*NB: Although many prospective students still associate the legacy of Droog with the Contextual Design Master’s, you have actively sought to push the department to not rest on this reputation. How has the student work evolved since the conceptual and collectible design of the early 2000s?*

*LS:* Well, I think Droog lost sight of its own starting points when it started to sell its once critical designs, such as Rag Chair and Milk Bottle Lamp, as expensive desirables. At the time of their conception, they could be read as comments on consumer society and as powerful DIY proposals, but gradually the platform turned into a market player not different from all the rest, and lost its revolutionary vibe. Of course, this tension of the market appropriating the experimental and making it desirable is unavoidable, and certainly for many graduates from the programme, the only way they can financially survive, regardless of their autonomous practice. But the logic of the market should not define the field and should definitely not define education. Within a school, one can and should work with the energy and adventurous vibe of young people wanting to make a difference in the world. Within a school one can thus freely experiment and focus on the larger narrative designers want to reveal with their interventions. 

As such, making and experimenting with materials has always characterized Contextual Design, but instead of focusing on the creation of objects as an ends, the output has gradually diversified. Students have made less and less products, and have focused more on installations as representations of a research of specific topics. The power of design resides in its being a way of reflecting on the world, and I see that many of our students deal with it accordingly. It's hard to only mention some highlights, but I can definitely name former students who marked turning points. Simone Farresin and Andrea Trimarchi (Formafantasma), and Sonja Bäumel, who graduated from this department when I was still a tutor and Contextual Design was named IM, demonstrated already in their graduation an approach to design research and materials that has gone on to become very influential. Another student from that year, Joana Meroz, has become a scientific design theorist, and many have followed her path ever since. This turn to science, but also the research and criticism that emerged in the year of Tamar Shafrir, were influential, ultimately leading to what is now the Critical Inquiry Lab. Aurely Hoegy who thematizes human madness in her designs, Théophile Blandet who is interested in the ubiquity of the internet and what that does to human perception, and Eva Jäger and Guillemette Legrand who explore the ethical implications of design also come to mind. 

A very influential graduate has been Jing He who with her Tulip Pyramid, used the school as a space from which to research and reflect on her own culture. She is certainly the designer mentioned most by prospective students these days, and I think this points to one of the strengths of Design Academy as a place for people from different cultures and fields to feel the freedom to reinterpret their own backgrounds. Many students, including Aram Lee, Weixiao Shen and Žan Kobal, investigated notions of cultural identity, the colonial pasts and how to deal with cultural artefacts in various parts of the world. Throughout the years, countless students have also experimented and reflected on material practices such as ceramics and weaving, including thix year’s Gijs Bakker Award-winner Meghan Clarke, and many have reflected on the design field itself, such as Tal Erez, Joel Blanco Martinez, Niall Keville and others.  

What has also become more and more apparent, is that although the department emphasises the individual and author designer, that students grow the most through their collaborations with each other. This is exemplified by this year’s graduates who, when confronted with their physical graduation show being cancelled, turned to Instagram and presented an excellent programme called “Live from the Living Room”.

---

*NB: This cultural self-reflexivity and collaborative platforming leads into what you and Michael Kaethler have called the auto-ethnographic turn in design, around which you are developing a book. What do you mean by this, and how did it emerge?*

*LS:* The auto-ethnographic turn emerges from the growing awareness that when creative personal expression drives research, deeply intimate and meaningful designs emerge; designs that resist solutionism to provide nuanced elaborations on particular social material relations. In a way, it brings together many of my intentions in the programme. I have always sought to facilitate the evolution of design by calling on a wide range of tutors and students, who come from various professional and cultural backgrounds. By emphasising personal autonomy, both students and tutors were encouraged to use their cultural and personal background and talents as starting points for projects. Through this, I have sought to prepare students for uncertain futures, in which the world and also the discipline will be reinvented, time and again, and a world in which the graduates need to find their own journey, also if they don’t become designers. The auto-ethnographic turn is what happens when designers become authors who are conscious of the implications of their perceptions of and role within the world — as we discussed in a [previous interview](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/news/interview-louise-schouwenberg).

---

*NB: Your successor has an impressive legacy to build on. What opportunities do you see for your successor?*

*LS:* The similarities in our approaches — such as the emphasis on the materiality and visuality of interventions — offer a basis from which to broaden the field in which students can operate, to explicitly include for instance public space interventions and architectural solutions. Furthermore, the political aspect of design, something the current department dealt with more indirectly, can be sharpened. My focus on philosophical, aesthetic and material qualities, will likely shift to the political, aesthetic and material qualities. But…. these are only assumptions, arguments that caused me to propose my successor. I am curious to their vision and programme and am delighted to leave the department in such capable hands.

*Jing He (Graduated in 2016)*

The famous Flower Pyramid, part of the Rijksmuseum’s archive, seems to be a seventeenth-century Dutch invention. However, its form refers to the Chinese pagoda and its motifs derive from those on Chinese porcelain. For her graduation in 2016, Jing He undertook a very personal and intensive research to figure out how she, as a young Chinese designer, had been shaped by various influences. “I began this project to continue the process of replicating and transforming which is the history of the original Tulip Pyramid. I wanted to explore the question of ‘creativity in copying’ and the question of identity. If a Tulip Pyramid were to be imitated nowadays in China – a country which is a mixture of common and private ownership, of collectivism and individualism, troubled by the issue of counterfeiting and appropriating intellectual property – what would the result be?”
 
Jing He invited three young Chinese designers, one artist, and one craftsman to reflect on their shared Chinese culture and the history of imitation and innovation. Each of them designed two layers of the new pyramid, all executed in different techniques, from traditional crafts to high tech media. Together they claim ownership of the final product, as can be seen on iPhone in the top, which shows all the collaborators. “I see myself as a Tulip Pyramid. My origins are in China and I’ve been transformed in the Netherlands into the person I currently am. My education in the Netherlands (first at the Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam, subsequently at Design Academy Eindhoven) gave me a new perspective on design. I used my personal experience to ask questions about mass-production and embedded it in a design discourse on originality, authenticity, and copying. For a second pyramid, I imitated and made a collage of references of famous Dutch designers’ iconic works, which I merged with my own former works. Thus I could question the influence of these designers and the educational institutions which have formed me into who I am today. On the top a 3D print of my head claims personal authorship.”
Jing He’s graduation from Eindhoven’s Masters programme in Contextual Design was granted a Cum Laude and the Gijs Bakker Award 2016 (best master project of that year). 

Since her graduation Jing He has continued to work on projects dealing with cultural phenomena in both her homecountry China and The Netherlands, where she lives and works. Projects include for instance Live Streaming (2018), an installation made for the exhibition ‘GEO–DESIGN: ALIBABA. FROM HERE TO YOUR HOME’, at the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven. Jing He’s work has been presented at various prestigious institutes, including Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam, Museum Princessehof Leeuwarden, Flux Factory New York, Artgallery Roehrs & Boetsch Zurich, Zuiderzeemuseum Enkhuizen, Frans Halsmuseum Haarlem, Vitra Design Museum Weil am Rhein.
