Missed Your Call saw 54 bachelor graduates take over a former industrial bakery, built in 1898, uncovering an architectural gem in the heart of Milan. 

The exhibition name was inspired by the cancellation of the 2020 Graduation Show due to the Covid-19 pandemic and was curated by Martina Muzi with DAE’s creative director Joseph Grima. 

'The exhibition Missed Your Call is an opportunity for those alumni of Design Academy Eindhoven who graduated from the Bachelors' department during the pandemic to show their work to the world,' they explained. 'While some projects have evolved and others have kept their original form, they all have in common that they were conceived and produced under bewildering circumstances – circumstances unprecedented in our lifetimes.'

The list of participants included Jade Badra, Angéline Behr, Emy Bensdorp, Charlotte Bombel, Noor Bootsma, Ethan Braunstein, Anton Brunberg, Rollo Bryant, Job Claassen, Maïté Denolf, Anna Dienemann, Arthur Etienne, Miya Fassbender, Olga Flór, Jean-Baptiste Gambier, Miles Le Gras, Fiona Herrod, Ieva Jakuša, Noa Jansma, Joel Kim, Santa Kupča, Heejoon Kwak, Sorrel Madley, Julia Maliczowska, Mathias Malm, Kaiu Meiner, Victor Miklos Andersen, Elsa Molinard, Paulien Nabben, Pollyanna Moss, Benjamin Motoc, James Murphie, Madeleine Oltra, Lotte Ottevanger, Phillipp Pals, Marie Panken, Manuel Pellegrini, Giulia Pompilj, Deborah van Putten, Ariana Radu, Lucas de Ruiter, Ilja Schamlé, Hannah Segerkrantz, Willeke Segers, Nanno Simonis, Jelle Smidt, Marwane Soumer, Gundega Strauberga, Ignacio Subías Albert, Lola Tual, Bram de Vos, Boey Wang, Nanyoung Yoon, and Teun Zwets. 

'[The curatorial team] have made a beautiful and fascinating selection,' said [architectenweb editor Robert Mouse](https://architectenweb.nl/nieuws/artikel.aspx?ID=50790) 'Missed Your Call shows a large and high level in the exhibition. The projects vary from highly conceptual to practically applicable and from personal to social.'

DAE also collaborated with Het Nieuw Instituut, with a public programme of events embedded within the show and interventions by Rotterdam-based Radio Stasis, which was born out of a partnership and exhibition between the museum’s Gallery 3 By You and a number of 2020 MA graduates.

Recent DAE graduates were also strongly represented at The Lost Graduation Show, the first major showcase of graduate work to be held within the Salone del Mobile, the furniture fair around which Milan Design Week developed. Salone del Mobile is the biggest fair of its kind and remains the most important, despite the impact of Covid-19. 

Graduation projects by Bastiaan Stoker, Elsa Molinard, Elsa Sier, Fiona Herrod, Hannah Segerkrantz, Paulien Nabben and Pollyanna Moss were among those selected from design schools around the world by The Lost Graduation Show’s curator Anniina Koivu. 

[Koivu told Wallpaper* magazine](https://www.wallpaper.com/design/salone-del-mobile-the-lost-graduation-show) that the exhibition demonstrated the ingenuity and also the awareness of this generation of graduates. 'We cannot necessarily speak any more about nationally located design, because the topics that the designers are touching are universal and global,' she said. 'Because of the pandemic, young designers didn’t have access to production facilities and it has been more difficult for them to get into the design industry, so they had to show a very positive proactive attitude... a crisis can be a very positive trigger for rethinking things and for new, innovative ideas.'

Although this year’s design week was a little more subdued than usual, taking place in a reduced version in September instead of the usual April due to the impact of Covid-19, it was still a moment for young and innovative designers to shine. DAE alumni were strongly represented across the city in the various design districts, including Alcova, Isola, and 5Vie and at smaller venues like Masterly, the Dutch pavilion, and independent galleries.
