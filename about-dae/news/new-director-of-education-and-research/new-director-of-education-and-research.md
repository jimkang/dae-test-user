## New Director of Education & Research

The master’s department GEO—DESIGN is a further expansion of the GEO—DESIGN exhibition platform launched in 2018, which explores the social, economic, territorial, and geopolitical forces shaping design today. The master’s department will acknowledge the legacy of industrial production as a fundamental source for the expertise and agency of the designer. At the same time, it will problematise and address industrial production’s contribution to environmental and social instability and its incompatibility with models of sustainable or even survivable futures.

Italian design duo Andrea Trimarchi (1983) and Simone Farresin (1980) are the founders of Amsterdam-based Studio Formafantasma. Their interest in product design developed while studying at DAE in the Contextual Design Master (formerly IM), which they graduated from in July 2009. Since then, Formafantasma has developed a body of work characterised by experimental material investigations and the exploration of issues such as the relationship between tradition and local culture, the ecological responsibilities of design and the significance of objects as cultural conduits.
