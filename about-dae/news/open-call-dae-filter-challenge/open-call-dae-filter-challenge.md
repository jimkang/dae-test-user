# OPEN CALL: DAE FILTER CHALLENGE

---

Something new! DAE is opening up its Instagram account to feature unique new work from students in the form of Instagram AR Filters. 

DAE’s Editorial Team is launching the DAE Filter Challenge – a monthly competition open to all current students – with the winning submissions shared on the DAE Instagram account.  

Send in your weirdest experiments, work in progress, filters created for a project, or completely new and polished filters! 

This challenge offers students a new public platform with a significant reach. The DAE Instagram account currently has almost 65,000 followers, meaning that submissions are likely to reach a large new audience of followers.  

This is an experimental project led by the DAE Editorial Team to surface some of the innovative work by our community, beyond the Graduation Show and final projects.  

Read on for more information about how to enter...

## How to take part  

Create a rough draft of your filter for Instagram in the Spark AR App and send us screenshots and a short text describing what your filter is and how it works. You can also share an existing completed work. Submissions should be sent via email to <communications@designacademy.nl> by 21 May.  

This challenge is open to all current DAE students. The winner will be selected by a jury made up of the Editorial Team of DAE and invited guests and the winner will be published on the DAE Instagram account and shared on the DAE website. 

The winning student will be commissioned on the same basis as a work student, and compensated for five hours of work (equivalent of €50).

## Background 

AR filters make objects appear in a space or alter existing objects – such as a human face – by superimposing computer-generated imagery. 

Instagram’s AR filters are primarily used within its Stories platform and were initially created as a response to similar content on Snapchat. They have been available on Instagram since 2017, but users were not able to upload their own designs until 2019, when Instagram opened up its Spark AR Studio to all of its users. Since then, engagement with filters has exploded exponentially, with a wide variety of creative approaches both by independent individuals who make them for fun and by professional designers and organisations.  

Many DAE students are already creating their own filters, sharing them via their personal accounts, and using filters produced by other Instagram users.

## How to make a filter 

Creating a filter using Instagram’s Spark AR tools is a relatively simple process. To begin designing, you will need to have an Instagram account and download the Spark AR app.  

The app offers you a variety of ways to create a filter. You can design one from scratch, edit a filter you have previously created or use an existing template.  

You must ensure that you use original graphics and imagery in your filter to avoid copyright issues, and check that your filter works before submitting it.  

Once you have designed your filter, you will need to take some screenshots and submit those to the editorial team, alongside a brief description of what your filter does.

## What happens next

After submissions have closed for this month’s challenge, the winner will be selected by a jury consisting of the Editorial Team and invited members from the DAE community. The Editorial Team will share the entries, names of jury members, judging methods and criteria via the DAE website. The entries will be judged based solely on the content submitted, with no additional information about the student, their course, etc.  

The winning student will work directly with a member of the Editorial Team to upload their work to the DAE Instagram account via Spark AR Studio.  

The Editorial Team will then submit the filter for approval. This can take days or weeks. If it is rejected, they will inform the student and follow up with any necessary amendments or new submissions as appropriate. If it is approved, they will inform the student and begin promoting it.  

Once approved by Instagram and published, the Editorial Team will cross-promote the filter via the DAE letter, Instagram stories, the DAE website and the DAE Twitter account.  

The filters will remain on the DAE account as an archive for the continuation of the project. They will also be archived on the DAE website as a record (in the first instance this will take the form of an article with static images for each winning filter).
