# DESIGN ACADEMY EINDHOVEN SOCIAL JUSTICE LAB

# CALL FOR PARTICIPANTS

“My body is an archive, my body is a history”
Karina Griffith

“There is no thing as a single-issue struggle because we do not live single-issue lives”
Audre Lorde

## The Social Justice Lab: Enabling Breathing, Belonging, and Becoming
No educational institution that takes itself seriously can allow to be detached from society and its passionate struggles for social justice. With the creation of the Social Justice Lab, Design Academy Eindhoven makes an effort to not only recognise these struggles, but to, importantly, wholeheartedly commit to enabling a sustained practice of “walking the walk” in the form of a critical diversity politics. We should, therefore, address the difficult issues of naming and working through the “elephants in the room”: over- and underrepresentation of certain social groups, and, going even deeper: grappling with harmful workings of power and privilege. The historic and unequal distribution of power/privilege in society and in our academy should be acknowledged and countered. Engaging with this means at the same time to work on uplifting avenues that are worthwhile, forging a radically different future that foregrounds a true sense of belonging. Especially for people who have felt excluded, misunderstood, and discriminated against.

To have a serious and ongoing discussion geared towards tangible results (“seeing is believing”) Dr Praveen Sewgobind is initiating a Social Justice Lab. This new hub where students and staff will get together is envisioned as a catalyst for change, a path towards impact, rather than a site

where we merely produce intentions. Central to its practical philosophy is the recognition that all too often diversity statements are - as social theorist Sara Ahmed has remarked - “non-performatives” (Ahmed 119), in other words, such statements tend to halt and frustrate, rather than open up and stimulate structural change. This might seem contradictory, but many Black people, people of colour, women, and those from LGBTQIA+ communities know all too well how this “diversity circularity” works. Merely displaying a person of colour on a website and stating an intention to work on diversity will not fundamentally alter a culture that has enabled differences in power/privilege. Analysing constructs of whiteness and patriarchy may be challenging and even uncomfortable, yet it is a necessary step to problematise social injustice. It is crucial that societal inequalities be understood as operating both systemically within society, but also in the form of socialisation/internalisation on a personal level, leading to, for example, implicit biases we all have.

The SJL embraces an intersectional and decolonial approach, while critiquing a neoliberal type of diversity politics, one that falsely informs us that we live in a society based on “equal opportunities for all.” Moreover, pointing to having “equal rights” has not subsided racism in society. On the contrary, it is rampant: on the job and housing “markets,” by the power of imagery, in political discourse, in Eurocentric textbooks, and by the presence of colonial statues. Below you can find a list of links to inspirational texts arising from this struggle. The SJL will take up the task of continuing this struggle by organising meaningful events and by urgently advising all those working and studying in the DAE to join in the transformation of our academy into a social justice hub inextricable to our ambitious goals of being a leading educational and research hub.

To have a functioning lab in the heart of the DAE, we will create a safe space, where we will meet and discuss, listen and learn, get inspired and feel empowered. The SJL will arduously work to materialise tangible goals and we will disseminate all this in full transparency and honesty. “Walking the walk,” that genuine and practical flipside of “talking the talk,” is underlying this initiative. We will engage in creative discussions and will formulate bold yet realistic goals. A necessary starting point is to view the world from the perspectives of marginalised groups, while recognising the pain and hardships that bodies are carrying.

To achieve this, a culture should develop where a listening mentality replaces an elbow mentality. Listening is a difficult process that requires true effort and enduring willingness. Only when we create a dynamic of veritable empathy and deep introspection, can we truly learn and see the need for changing our practices…as well as ourselves.

The SJL wishes to be a DAE-wide hub and therefore kindly asks for active participation from students and staff. For now, the project is run on a volunteering basis and requires a time investment of about 4 hours per month. We're exploring options for time and effort to be accredited. We will meet on a monthly basis and will produce regular plans of action directed to the whole DAE community.

Please send a short motivation (maximum 250 words) to Dr Sewgobind's DAE email address (praveen.sewgobind@designacademy.nl), explaining why you want to join the SJL. Submissions are encouraged by 16 April, while the call remains open for an ongoing period. After first submissions have been received, a workable format will be chosen, grounded in consensus-based basic-democratic principles in which involvement of participants will rotate. 

The Social Justice Lab will be welcoming anyone committed to the social justice struggles we embrace.
