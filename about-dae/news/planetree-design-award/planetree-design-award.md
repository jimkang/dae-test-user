# PLANETREE DESIGN AWARD

---

Starting in 2021, DAE has renewed its collaboration with mental healthcare institution GGzE De Grote Beek in Eindhoven. The collaboration entails an annual award, the Planetree Design Award, lectures and excursions from GGzE by experts on mental health, and a yearly seminar on mental health during DDW. The main goal of the collaboration is to inspire students from DAE and to offer insights on social innovation to clients and experts of GGzE, as well as sharing and exchanging knowledge on design and mental health.

From on February 2021 students could participate in online lectures and workshops with GGzE. Some students got in touch with mental health professionals to get feedback on their projects. Until mid-August, all students could apply for the Planetree Design Award, resulting in the nomination of eight projects, which are related to mental health. Last Thursday 23 September, five mental health and design professionals listened to the nominees and discussed who would be the first winner of the Planetree Design Award.

The winner of the Planetree Award 2021 is Mirte van der Nat! 

The nominees of the Planetree Award 2021 are:

Valentine Maurice, MA 2nd year
Josephine de Fijter, MA 1st year
Laura Deschl, MA 2nd year
Bruno Szenk, BA 3rd year
Margarida Coelho, MA 1st year
Mirte van der Nat, BA, 4th year
Katharina Freiin von Stackelberg, BA 2nd year
Anabel Poh, BA 4th year

Mood, Katharina Freiin von Stackelberg, BA 2nd year
‘Mood’ is a mood tracker, that does not only track the intensity of your moods, but helps you understand them better. Through courses within the app, it introduces you gradually to the pan-model, and as you progress, you gain new functions. These include journaling, mindfulness, ways of coping, distracting, affirmations, etc. The app is community based to break the stigma around mental illness and the isolation. There are so many people that can relate to your struggles, and that will not make you feel alienated.

The Old School Club, Anabel Poh, BA 4th year
‘The Old School Club’ is an intergenerational social club that promotes the passing down of knowledge and skills. It facilitates interest-based connections between the elderly and individuals who would like to learn from them. The online platform also serves as an ever-expanding archive of members that have interesting insights to share, ranging from shell collecting to astronomy photography to engineering. The fun, light-hearted entrance to the club is designed to celebrate the elderly and their knowledge.

The Grounding Ritual, Margarida Coelho, MA, 1st year
‘The Grounding Ritual’ is a connection between mental health and being close to nature without damaging it. It involves collecting things from your surroundings and creating the items you need for the ritual itself. With the use of specific pressure points, allied to smells and the texture of the items, we can design an effective way to calm down and relax.

Therefore, ‘the Grounding Ritual’ is to be performed whenever you feel stressed, anxious, drained, and lonely. The ritual starts with the preparation and ends with the diluting it back with water, leaving no trace in the nature: the process is the ritual.

Navigating Stress, Mirte van der Nat, BA, 4th year (on display at the Graduation Show 2021) WINNER
‘Navigating Stress’ is a conversation toolkit that enables young adults to have a low-threshold conversation concerning stress, to increase knowledge and self-reflection. The kit includes stamps to activate people to build personal stress landscapes, challenge cards to frame the conversation, and a fictional map that provides a language and visual aid for discussions on what one experiences as stress, and what routes one can take to get from one state of mind to another. The map includes both negative and positive aspects of stress, so that one might come to form a holistic view of stress.

Aiki, Josephine de Fijter, MA, 1st year
‘Aiki’ (Japanese for ‘being in connection with your breath’) is a design proposal for a cuddle that with its breathing movement is a soothing tool to re-learn a healthy breathing rhythm. Within a therapeutic setting, it can be used as a tool by the practitioner to bring the child back into their body. With biofeedback sensors, it measures the heart rate of the child. From the heart rate, it is transformed into a coloured light, informing the therapist the state of being of the child. Currently, Josephine have received interest from parents of children with a handicap and parents who have children that are regularly admitted for medical care.

The metaphorical screen, Valentine Maurice, MA, 2nd year (on display at the Graduation Show 2021)
This project explores new technologies and light therapy and questions their role to relieve insomnia, anxiety, and depression. It uses neuro aesthetics and cognitive recognition as ways to relieve the mind from hyperactivity and anxiety, bringing the mind into sync with the body. The concept proposes to link the frequency of the body with a colour pattern creating a visual impression and thus externalizing the hyperactivity and anxiety that occurs in mental disorders.

The Healing Imprint, Laura Deschl, MA, 2nd year (on display at the Graduation Show 2021)
‘The Healing Imprint’ explores the therapeutic potentials of knitted acupressure garments and an embodied practice for emotional healing from psycho-trauma. A bodysuit, gloves, socks, and a pillow become tools to stimulate acupoints on body, hands, feet, and the head. The garment is not only an interface for an individual to access embodied knowledge and self, but also represents how design can converge fields such as science, business, medicine, psychiatry, and textile making in an ongoing process of knowledge creation. With an aesthetic embracing fashion and wellbeing, the garment seeks to destigmatize the realm of mental health and make visible what is invisible to us: the traces trauma has left on the body.

A (mobile) bureau for restorative futility, Bruno Szenk, BA 3rd year
‘Mobile bureau’ explores ways to actively suspend our outsider view on ‘nature’ in the process of unlearning: a less certain and more cautious way to attune to it. The project was contextualized in ‘a park’, a hybrid, natural-cultural construct corresponding to our romantic vision of ‘nature’. In a series of participant observations, (as well as performative and material explorations) Szenk attempted to deconstruct that context and repurpose his being in the park into a situation of unlearning. Finally, a toolkit for unlearning ‘nature’ emerged: it took a form of a map that guides its reader to perform a series of activities at the site of a park. Included in the kit is a body-antenna; a speculative device that helps its user to enact the gesture of broadcasting their own heartbeat, to whatever they think might listen.
