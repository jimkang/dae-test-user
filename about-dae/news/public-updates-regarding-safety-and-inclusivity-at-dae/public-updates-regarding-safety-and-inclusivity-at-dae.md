# PUBLIC UPDATES REGARDING SAFETY AND INCLUSIVITY AT DAE

---

## Start investigation social safety and culture DAE

*By Executive Board, 15 December 2020*

Dear DAE students, tutors, staff and alumni,

Today the investigation after the overall DAE environment and working culture in Design Academy Eindhoven starts. As we informed you earlier Bezemer & Schubad carries out this extra external, independent and thorough investigation into the academy. Bezemer & Schubad have vast experience and an excellent reputation in this field, and we are confident they will offer a clear and impartial assessment of the circumstances and guide us in the future improvement of conditions for everyone in DAE.

The goal of this assessment is to address experiences of intimidation, sexual harassment, bullying, discrimination, aggression, non-inclusion, violence, or other forms of social insecurity that you may have experienced. Please note that this investigation is not only into inappropriate behaviour. We are also interested in more subtle, silent or hidden aspects of a culture that makes you feel unsafe.

We would like to stress that while we will take all allegations of misconduct seriously, this is not a witch-hunt and staff should not feel insecure or intimidated. We have absolute confidence in our extraordinary community as a whole. We must and will address the individual instances that we have been already made aware of, but our larger goal is to understand what can be done to make DAE a better environment for all — students and staff alike.

Attached you find an invitation from Bezemer & Schubad to participate in this investigation. In this invitation they explain their working method and they guarantee the anonymity and confidentiality of all who reach out to Bezemer & Schubad.

As Executive Board we cannot stress enough the importance and urgency of this investigation. We take it serious and act upon the final findings and advice of Bezemer & Schubad. Therefore, we urge you all to participate in order to create a safe learning and working environment.

Sincerely,
Executive Board

## Executive board announces investigation into overall DAE environment and working culture

*By Executive Board, 4 December 2020*

Following recent allegations of impropriety on the part of Design Academy staff, the Executive Board decided to engage the company Bezemer & Schubad to investigate the overall DAE environment and working culture. Bezemer & Schubad have vast experience and an excellent reputation in this field, and we are confident they will offer a clear and impartial assessment of the circumstances and guide us in the future improvement of conditions for everyone at the academy. The assessment will be open for all students, tutors, staff and alumni. Bezemer & Schubad will begin as early as next week, and we will be communicating to you their process as soon as they share it with us.

Design Academy Eindhoven should be a safe environment for all its students, tutors and staff. Those who do not respect or who violate this safe environment do not belong to our community. All students, tutors and staff – the EB included – must at all times be aware of the responsibility they carry and act accordingly. Ensuring DAE is a safe space for all, and not just for some, is the responsibility of the Executive Board. 

It is only in an environment of harmony and reciprocal respect that we will be able to achieve our goals as an institution.

Kind regards,
The Executive Board,
Joseph Grima
Mechtild van den Hombergh

## The steps we are taking next

*By executive board, ARC, Student Council 1 December 2020*

Dear DAE community,

Following up on our letter of two weeks ago, we would like to inform you all about the concrete steps we discussed in our meeting on 24 November.

Reacting to the demands of the ARC, the Executive Board compiled a detailed, written list of measures to implement an anti-racist and inclusivity-oriented culture within DAE. In this meeting, we discussed four of the most pressing steps that should be made a reality as quickly as possible.

— Anti-racist trainings for teachers, staff and students
This point was already addressed in the last meeting on 11 November, but the importance of it has been reiterated and an action plan has been created:

• Several Anti-Racist Lectures will be set up between now and 1 September 2021, from then on the diversity of speakers and topics linked to diversity will become a fixed part of the structure of public lectures at DAE.

• Sensitivity Trainings on Teacher Days will be implemented as soon as 17 December, when the first of these days is going to take place. This Teacher Day will include a sensitivity training.

• A forum for students and teachers to facilitate a conversation specifically about race and diversity issues will be set up between January and May 2021. This process will be started by collecting input from the student body and pinpointing recurring topics, which will be discussed by dedicated topic-teams from the student body with a group of 9–16 teachers from three studios and master courses. The discussion will be led by a moderator that is yet to be decided upon.

— Group Agreements and Anonymous Teacher Evaluation Forms
Group Agreements will be set up next semester in all BA departments. These agreements are meant to be generated collectively with students and studio leaders and ensure that there is a clear understanding of what forms and tones of communication are acceptable for everyone. They are also meant to formalise acceptable ways of working for both sides and clarify how these have been decided upon. Detailed instructions on this will be sent in a separate email.

Anonymous Teacher Evaluation Forms are going to become a reality with a pilot project starting next semester in all BA studios. The questions on these forms will be related to the culture and environment within the studios and drawn up by ARC in co-operation with Student Council. Additionally, operational and content-related questions will be added by the Executive Board. Detailed instructions on this will be sent in a separate email. These tools are planned to be implemented for the whole institution by the third trimester of the BA Propaedeutic Year and the master programmes.

— Internal and Independent complaint system within DAE
A number of students within DAE and all over the country believe that the way in which complaints are handled within educational institutions is broken. This is why multiple initiatives have emerged recently to take on the task of changing these systems. The Executive Board has made an acknowledgement of the state of this system within DAE, and it is also agreed upon by the parties involved that all energy will be put into changing this system, not just pointing out its flaws.

A first concrete step towards this transformation is a clearer communication from the Executive Board about the specific measures that are taken when a complaint is filed. At the same time, this demands a certain level of trust from the student body which is to be re-established and a mutual understanding that the treatment of every case is different and needs to be carefully deliberated.Further, the wish has been expressed to make it obligatory for all coordinators to document every offence by teaching personnel that is being reported to them by students.

— Representation of BIPOC on the Institutional Participation Committee
The question of diverse representation of the student body on the newly established IPC was also raised by the Anti-Racist Committee. Since the student body elects student members of the IPC, its diversity is not decided by the Executive Board but rather by the votes from the student body.

 
With Kind Regards,
On behalf of,

DAE Executive Board, Anti-Racist Committee and DAE Student Council

## Statement recent social media posts

*By executive board, 1 December 2020*

To all members of the Design Academy community,

Late last week we were surprised to learn that police had been asked to investigate the comments made by several individuals (including DAE alumni) on a recent post alleging impropriety by a head of department/ studio leader.

DAE did not request the involvement of the police to suppress the opinions expressed by those commenting on these posts. Over the weekend we have been in direct contact with individuals who reached out to us to offer support and counsel.

DAE takes the prior allegations of impropriety extremely seriously and, as announced last week by email to the community, an external organisation has been tasked with investigating allegations that have been made and advising us on appropriate action. This investigative action will begin at the earliest possible time. Impropriety of any kind has no place at DAE, and will not be tolerated.
We cannot and will not respond to every social media post published in this light. We believe it is important to communicate with our internal community, students and staff first. We are now focusing on the investigations and will keep you informed.

We deeply regret these unpleasant and demeaning developments at a time that is already incredibly difficult for students and staff alike.

Best,
Joseph Grima
Raf De Keninck
Mechtild van den Hombergh

## Announcement assessment overall DAE environment and working culture

*Posted on 26 November 2020*

Dear members of the DAE community,

On November 3, we as Executive Board sent you an email on how to report an incident or a concern. Of course, it is our duty to follow up on concerns expressed in order to make sure issues are addressed at the root. Our greatest responsibility toward the community is to ensure a safe environment in which the comfort  and wellbeing of everyone, both students and staff, is guaranteed. It is only in an environment of harmony and reciprocal respect that we will be able to  achieve our goals as an institution.

— Assessment
The Executive Board decided to assign an independent external agency to perform an assessment on the general environment and culture, with a view to identifying critical situations that may affect the wellbeing of students and staff within the school. The assessment, led by professionals specialized in this, will start from instances of discomfort that have been made known to us, and will guide us in the future improvement of conditions for everyone at the academy. The EB is discussing this assignment with two specialists in this field and will decide mid next week who will perform the assessment, after which we inform you. The method of assessment depends on the specialist we choose. More info on this will follow soon.

— Mores
Mores is an independent disclosure office for undesirable behavior in the performing arts, film and television sectors, art education and museums. The collective Dutch art schools (including DAE) decided to align with Mores and you can contact Mores if you prefer not to contact DAE’s own confidential counselors. Mores offers certified confidential advisors that listen to your story or complaints and can advise you what to do. They cooperate with ethologists and lawyers if necessary. Mores works in absolute confidence, and you can even stay anonymous if you contact them. If you feel the need to report incidents, Mores will be there for you https://mores.online. Their site is available in Dutch and English.

— DAE confidential counselors
Just to remind you, DAE has two confidential counselors in place for students, tutors and staff. Both work independent and guaranty your anonymity:
• Yolande Hezemans is DAE’s internal confidential counsellor (<yolande.hezemans@designacademy.nl>)
• DAE’s confidential counsellors are:

Tamara de Reu <dereu@devertrouwenspersoon.nl>
T +31 610 917 087

Jeroen Zweerts <zweerts@devertrouwenspersoon.nl>
T +31 626 698 484

Both are associated with “De Vertrouwenspersoon” (The Confidant), an organization that operates nationwide and works exclusively with professional and qualified employees.

— Safe Environment
We as Executive Board cannot state enough that Design Academy Eindhoven should be a safe environment for all its students, tutors and staff. Those who do not respect or violate this safe environment do not belong to our community. All students, tutors and staff, ourselves included, must at all times be aware of the responsibility they carry and act accordingly. Ensuring DAE is a safe space for all, and not  just for some, is our responsibility.

## A message from DAE Executive Board, Anti-Racist Committee and DAE Student Council

*Posted on 19 November 2020*

Dear DAE community,

On June 3rd, the Executive Board of the Design Academy published a letter seeking to address issues of diversity and racism within the institution. In that letter they pledged to do everything possible to achieve concrete improvements in a short timeframe, and at the same time, asked students to use the considerable means at their disposal to influence the decisions that are made within the school. To that end, a group of current students and alumni, working together with external experts, created a 6 point program, consisting of 28 demands, which seeks to directly tackle the systemic racism, and discrimination which has been experienced by students of the Design Academy. 

— A collaboration between the Board, the Student Council and the ARC
On October 27th, this group of students, known as the Anti-Racist Committee (ARC), along with represenatives of Student Council (SC) met for the first time with the Executive Board to discuss the 6 point program. What followed was the beginning of a frank and open discussion which sought to outline the pragmatic steps that are being taken by the Board, and the administration to address the issues highlighted by the ARC.This first discussion led to the agreement of a series of meetings leading up to the new year to continue this conversation. 

— Clear communication
There was an acknowledgement that there remains a lack of visibility and communication to the wider DAE community about what these steps will be, and how students can provide meaningful feedback that can help shape their implementation.  As such, working together with members from the ARC and SC, the Board has agreed to create more open and transparent lines of communication with the student body about what efforts are being made to directly address racism and discrimination within the school. The first such effort towards this greater transparency will be the publication of a monthly report, outlining the conversations held by this working group, any decisions that are made through it, and a clear description of the next steps being taken in addressing racism and other forms of discrimination within the school. 
 
— Planned measures
The newly created Bachelor Course Committee, as well as the still to be assembled Masters Course Committee will be tasked with evaluating and proposing changes to the current curriculum at DAE. These official committees will be made up of elected, paid representatives from the student body, as well as teachers, who will collectively work towards creating a curriculum that is more representative of and responsive to the needs of DAE students. 

One of the three new Readerships will be devoted to structural transformation and decolonisation of the Design Academy itself. The research and focus of this Readership is meant to offer clear and actionable suggestions that will lead to more structural changes within the school. This is announced last Tuesday by the Board. For more information can be find on DAE website readerships.  
 
Finally, for teachers in the bachelors courses, during the biannual Teacher Days, a workshop is being organized which is meant to address issues of discrimination, racism, and inclusivity. 
 
— Follow us to know about further developments
As the conversation among the ARC, Student Council and the Board continues to unfold in the coming months, we hope to utilize various platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and emails to keep the DAE community informed and the actions of the working group as transparent as possible. We recognize that the changes outlined by this first letter are small, and incremental. However, it is our hope that they represent the beginning of a longer and more substantive change to the culture of discrimination and racism which has marked the history of the institution and towards a more inclusive and equitable future. 
 

With Kind Regards, 
On behalf of,

DAE Executive Board, Anti-Racist Committee and DAE Student Council
