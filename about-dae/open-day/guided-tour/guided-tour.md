# GUIDED TOUR

The next best thing to showing you around in person is our virtual walk through the building with two of our students, who’ll take you on a live guided tour. Follow Paloma via live stream, where she will take you on a tour through the Academy's building and give a glimpse of the study environment with its material workshops, dedicated study spaces, library and cafeteria. 

Join the Guided Tour at: 

→ 1:00-2:00 PM, CEST
→ 3:00-4:00 PM, CEST
→ 4:00-5:00 PM, CEST

## HOW IT WORKS

This event is arranged across seven digital ‘rooms’, each with a different programme that you can explore at your own pace from 12:00 till 5:00 PM, CEST. Have a look at the timetable on the right of this page to see what’s happening.

You can hop from one room to another and meet tutors, students and representatives from the Student Council and student administration, as well as the student counsellor, to ask questions and find inspiration.

Please note that we will use Microsoft Teams during this day. For an optimal experience, we advise you to download the app for free via [the Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/nl-nl/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app).

If you have any questions or trouble logging in, please send an email to <bachelors@designacademy.nl>.
