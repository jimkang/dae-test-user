## HOW IT WORKS

This event is arranged across seven digital ‘rooms’, each with a different programme that you can explore at your own pace from 12:00 till 5:00 PM, CEST. Have a look at the timetable on the right of this page to see what’s happening.

You can hop from one room to another and meet tutors, students and representatives from the Student Council and student administration, as well as the student counsellor, to ask questions and find inspiration.

Please note that we will use Microsoft Teams during this day. For an optimal experience, we advise you to download the app for free via [the Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/nl-nl/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app).

If you have any questions or trouble logging in, please send an email to <bachelors@designacademy.nl>.
