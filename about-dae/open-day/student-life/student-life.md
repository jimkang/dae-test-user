# STUDENT LIFE

Design Academy Eindhoven is home to a community of over 700 students from more than 40 different countries. This diversity is a key element of DAE’s identity and a large factor in its status as one of the world’s most influential design schools.

The meeting of nationalities, cultures, backgrounds and abilities within the school enriches the work of the entire DAE community and helps student designers understand their projects within a global context. This is an institute where debate and difference are always welcome.

Every year students of DAE organise an introduction camp. During this week you get to meet the city of [Eindhoven](https://www.thisiseindhoven.com/en) and its surroundings. Play games, party and of course get to know your fellow classmates. Last year during covid-19 the introcamp was mostly online. Of course we hope to welcome you in real-life this summer like we did previous years, [click here to see some after movies](https://vimeo.com/user55494451?fbclid=IwAR11s2j1y-0JJz9jr-4X8Iz8iumdjd06zyPcStgiQ_jdnPsbkVzK3Ihnkxc).

Many students make life-long friends during their time at the Academy and find that the network of fellow students they form while studying becomes an invaluable part of their professional life after graduation.
