# PRESS
Design Academy Eindhoven is one of the world’s leading design schools and stages a number of events throughout the year that have become significant moments for the media. These include the annual Graduation Show during Dutch Design Week in October, as well as exhibitions at Eindhoven’s Van Abbemuseum and in Milan during the city’s design week.

The DAE press team is happy to help journalists with requests for interviews, images of student projects and special access to the school if appropriate.
