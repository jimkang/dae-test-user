# DAE LECTURE SERIES

## Design Academy Eindhoven’s Lecture Series brings leading practitioners from the field of design – as well as practitioners from other disciplines such as art, craft, curation, education, the humanities and science – to the Academy to share their ideas and work with the public. It attracts some of the world’s most influential and exciting creative voices.

---

The series was created in 2018 and offers around nine lectures over each academic year. Topics covered have included subjects as diverse as the circular economy, the problem with ‘design thinking’ and living as a goat.

Anyone can attend a talk, with tickets available via Eventbrite. One of the main objectives of making the lectures publicly accessible lectures is to forge a stronger bond with the city of Eindhoven.

Past lectures have attracted between 200 and 300 attendees, with an audience made up of DAE community members, design and culture industry professionals and members of the public.

Since March 2020, the Lecture Series has taken place online, with lectures hosted via Instagram Live. This has enabled the events to continue despite the coronavirus.

## LECTURE SERIES COMMITTEE 

Design Academy Eindhoven's public lecture series is organised by current students in close collaboration with members of the Executive Board and staff. Students are invited to share their dream line-up of lecturers each academic year, via an open submissions system that includes public sign-up sheets posted around the Academy building and an open call for suggestions via email.

The Lecture Series Committee sorts through the students’ nominations, creating a shortlist of speakers in collaboration with DAE’s Creative Director Joseph Grima. Their aim is to identify inspiring speakers from a diverse range of backgrounds and disciplines, invite new perspectives into the Academy and create a platform for the sharing of different types of knowledge. 

Once the shortlist is draft, the committee is responsible for securing the speakers, and arranging and publicising the talks. Any student can join the committee, with vacancies advertised via email.

The committee is made up of current Bachelor and Master students and is a subsidiary of the Student Council. It has its own budget and receives support from the Communications, Relations and Events department.
