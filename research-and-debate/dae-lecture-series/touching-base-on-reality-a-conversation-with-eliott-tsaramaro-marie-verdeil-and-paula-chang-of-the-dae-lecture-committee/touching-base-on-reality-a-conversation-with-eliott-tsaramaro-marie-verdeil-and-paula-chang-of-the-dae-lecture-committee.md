# TOUCHING BASE ON REALITY

## A Conversation with Eliott Tsaramaro, Marie Verdeil and Paula Chang of the DAE Lecture Committee

---

The DAE Lecture Committee is currently composed of seven students who organise the [DAE Lecture Series](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/research-and-debate/dae-lecture-series) and set up talks by creative professionals on a monthly basis during the school term. These events are accessible to the entire DAE community. 

The current Lecture Committee is led by their most senior members Paula Chang, Eliott Tsaramaro and Marie Verdeil. In January this year, Jeannette Petrik from [DAE's Editorial Team](https://designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/dae/editorial-team) met them virtually to discuss their vision for the committee, its collective ambitions and the complexity of student life as community organisers during the ongoing pandemic.

→ Jeannette Petrik: Could you start by introducing yourselves and telling me a bit about your roles within the Lecture Committee?

→ Paula Chang: I'm a second-year student of the Master Critical Inquiry Lab. I joined the Lecture Committee in my first year at DAE. Within the committee, I often moderate events and usually contact potential speakers, write invitations and set up meetings with speakers before a lecture.  

→ Eliott Tsaramaro: I'm in the third year of the Food Non Food Bachelor. I enjoy being part of the Lecture Committee, I joined when I was in my first year at DAE. I do many things as part of the Lecture Committee, some communications, some logistics. I'm the link between different actors and take care of practical issues and internal communications.  

→ Marie Verdeil: I'm in my third year of the Bachelor in Communication, or Moonshots, as it's called now. In the Lecture Committee, I'm in charge of the graphics and external communication. I work together with two other members of the Lecture Committee to create the graphics for each event and support the rest of the team where necessary.  

→ JP: What's the current vision of the Lecture Committee?  

→ PC: Our vision came together last summer during lockdown. At the time, we were thinking a lot about the Coronavirus and the uncertainty it brought, together with the reports of police brutality that became public in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement. The keywords of this school year, for us, are inclusivity and diversity. We kept the risk of tokenism in mind and, therefore, invited speakers with an aim for diversity of race, gender and nationality, but also in terms of content that they would talk about, away from Euro-centric, Western ideas.  

→ MV: We also pay attention to going beyond topics of design. We noticed that the previous lecture committee was much more focused on design in its vision. We decided to open up to other topics because we felt like this was needed in order to reflect back on our creative practices after the lockdown in March, feeling stuck in this design world which tends to be Western-centered. We also considered issues of inclusivity and concerns raised by the student body. The idea was to reflect on these topics during the series of seminars.  

→ PC: We wanted to touch base on reality, which isn't only about design and art. This is a way for us to prepare ourselves to move forward, to peek into the societal reality after design education.  

→ ET: We’re working more precisely than before and broader at the same time. Broad, because we decided to look for more diversity and include many points of view. Precise, because this is the first time we were following one editorial direction of focus with the events. We can say that our vision is to be more precise about being broad.  

→ JP: What are your thoughts on accessibility – how have the current restrictions changed the reach of the events, what are the challenges and opportunities?  

→ MV: It feels important to say that the lecture series is only two-and-a-half years old and we're still learning a lot. Having to adapt to this online format has raised a lot of new questions. In general, our vision, or theme, helps to frame what we do. We could also go much broader but we want to invite people to speak who are right for our community at this moment in time. It's also great to have the support of the school, which feels like a great opportunity. The challenge is to find a suitable frame and format, setting boundaries and finding a workflow for the committee.  

→ PC: I feel like the current situation is affecting our internal communication more than the external communication. We used to have physical meetings at school which were running smoothly. It's a challenge to adapt to digital communication in this way. For external communication, it's actually easier to deal with the changed circumstances of organising online events.  

→ MV: The physical format, which we were used to, was open to everyone but it was mainly accessible to the DAE community. Everything was a bit more low-key. You could just show up to the lecture and we had beers afterwards. Some people came to the lectures just because they happened to be in the building, there was a kind of randomness to the event. This doesn’t happen with online talks. On the other hand, we are getting a lot more attention from outside of the school through social media. But we may be losing the day-to-day community in some aspects. In a very pragmatic way, we have become part of the face of the school.  

→ ET: The current situation is disrupting what we've gotten used to. We need to consider how to keep people interested, how to adapt the format. We recently collaborated with the [5th Floor Talks from the Masters and invited Metahaven[(https://designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/events/5th-floor-talks-metahaven) for a lecture. For me personally, this was the first time I experienced a format using breakout rooms, having people split in different places to have conversations in a smaller circle. From experiences like these, we have feedback sessions within the committee about the size of the audience, the format, the level of participation. I wonder if digital formats allow for more critical thinking and finding new perspectives towards future formats. In the end, nothing is taken for granted. That's maybe what the pandemic taught to all of us. 

→ JP: How do you identify potential speakers and how do you avoid tokenism in your approach?  

→ PC: In September last year, we conducted a survey amongst DAE students and asked what kind of topic they wanted us to explore, or for specific speakers. This survey was the base for our programming. We brought the results of the survey into our weekly meetings and had discussions and agreed to invite a speaker.  

→ MV: We are currently seven members in the Lecture Committee and we're all interested in different topics and bring different perspectives and diversity to the group.  

→ ET: Our approach to diversity is more than symbolic because we represent a certain diversity as a group. In a broad sense, we want to have a large variety of people and topics within the committee. Reminded by initiatives from students but also reacting to current social movements, we realised that we need to question ourselves and how diverse our work in the committee really is. Beyond an equal rate of male and female speakers, are we really diverse with topics and with the representation of speakers? We want to tackle this focus on diversity, however large the topic may be. 

→ MV: We have a layered approach. We always consider gender, race and points of view or perspectives, but it feels like ticking boxes when you do this. This is something we want to avoid, that's why we talk about diversity in a broader sense than just gender or race. We also want to have a mix of more known and lesser-known speakers. We also value inviting speakers with a lower profile using the institutional budget. Last year, we invited Girls Like Us, which is a queer magazine from Brussels. I think it was great to have a humbler perspective and to get insights into the reality of struggling as an artist or as a young, independent designer.  

→ PC: In a way, we're supporting our fellow artists and designers. Another point is a diversity in locations of the speakers. Before, when lectures were held physically, we were limited to speakers located in the Netherlands, or Europe at least. But now, we have speakers from South America, South Africa, the USA. That's an advantage of this year's format.   

→ JP: How do you make sure that what speakers are talking about is relevant to the community of DAE?  

→ ET: We try to question the relevance of topics and practices at a particular moment in time.   

→ MV: In general, we're interested to hear about the experiences of professionals, because we are a school and a lot of people are curious about the everyday. We are part of the student body and are aware of what our fellow students care about because we reflect on what we see from our peers. In a way, we are an alternative source of education, which is personal. We care about keeping this student's perspective, which is somewhat unique because it's based on what we feel in the school and how we feel as students. We like to place ourselves as a bridge between the organisation of the school and the students.  

→ JP: What are your thoughts on the experience of running the Lecture Committee next to studying?  

→ MV: Being an active member of the Lecture Committee is very time consuming. It's a great experience and I’ve learned a lot about doing this work in a way that feels down to earth. I appreciate the diversity within the committee, it's very valuable for me to be around different people, especially now at this moment in time. It's important for me to be involved in the life of the school and to have a broad experience of being a student.  

→ ET: Even if it can be intense sometimes, I enjoy being involved. So if I wasn't part of the LC I still might be busy with something else. Personally, I joined the committee because I was interested to broaden my experience and not necessarily expecting to be taught everything in class. This is a platform for doing something in a professional way, in contact with practitioners.  

→ MV: We also have to hand the committee to the next generation, which means that we have four more people now, some of them are really already very involved and some are less. It was the same for us, in the beginning we were a little less involved. We still need to figure out how to set boundaries and the rules of the workflow, and to explain this to other people so that they can continue. Because otherwise, it feels like you have to reinvent the wheel every year. If we would build upon each other every year, we can go much further much faster.  

→ PC: My experience with the Lecture Committee is very positive. I feel like we have managed to find a good balance for ourselves, it's the teamwork that matters. The way we collaborate is really supportive for us. It's as though we're stepping outside the academic reality. I wasn't expecting this at all and I'm loving it.  

→ MV: I think that being part of the Lecture Committee has been a great, down-to-earth experience. The school has a very individualistic workflow in general, you have your design practice or your projects and even though we sometimes work on group assignments you just have to get by. In this context where the team effort is what matters because what we do is for the student body, it's for a bigger goal in a way, which is a great balance to the normal, the routine of designing. In my opinion, being part of the Lecture Committee could be a paid position, because we do so much work, but I also think that the fact that we're not paid gives us certain freedoms because we have nothing to lose. I never feel limited or censored by the school. I feel a lot of respect for us and I think that the school appreciates this new vision.  

→ JP: What can we expect from the Lecture Committee in the near and in the more distant future?   

→ MV: We might team up with the radio network that's emerging at DAE. That may be a new way to have a larger diversity of formats. We have talked about having more panels and maybe interviews.  

→ PC: Going back to the difference between this year and last year, I feel like there's a lot of flexibility within us because of the circumstances. I know that in previous years speakers were scheduled a couple of months in advance, but we just can't do that. We look for speakers a month or two in advance. We really need to be much more flexible than before.  

→ ET: Maybe flexibility is becoming our trademark. Design Academy Eindhoven is generally working with a more fixed frame of planning throughout the year. We can allow ourselves to change more spontaneously and have the capability to change format and experiment.
