# THE LEXICON OF DESIGN RESEARCH

## At Design Academy Eindhoven, design research takes place in every department and on every course. It is an integral part of what we do. However, research methods and approaches take a variety of different forms across the BA, MA and dedicated research programmes such as our Readerships.

---

We are extremely proud of the diversity of design research practices undertaken within the Academy.
Different departments and studios focus on various subjects, each using their preferred, specific methods. This can include design research through include objects, services, events, spaces, drawings, films, texts, maps, styles, identities, scenarios and beyond. 

With this rich repertoire of approaches, it has become increasingly important to define a common language to explicitly discuss and share knowledge and expertise in the field of design research. 

By mapping the multitude of existing approaches to research within the Academy, we have developed a shared vocabulary that enables us to describe and understand what we have in common. This has resulted in the Lexicon of Design Research, containing a variety of concepts that together characterise our practice. 

For example, all departments seem to emphasise the relevance of ‘thinking through making’. At DAE we do not ‘just’ think or ‘just’ make – we engage in thinking through the act of making, a design research approach in which the material and the discursive are interrelated. Put simply, thinking is not only expressed through text but also through everything we make. Thinking through making, therefore, is a process in which both making and thinking alternate back and forth rapidly, all the time, helping to reinforce intuitive and insightful design.

The Lexicon describes concepts such as these and also gives visual examples of specific projects from our students and Readerships’ research associates that provide practical examples of each concept in action.

You can view the Lexicon at [lexiconofdesignresearch.com](http://www.lexiconofdesignresearch.com/). 

The Lexicon of Design Research is not a finished, static manifestation of our understanding of the entire Academy’s design research practice. Instead, it is an invitation for all members of the design community to engage in a conversation around these common concepts, terms and ideas. 

To this end, writing days with students and tutors and Lexicon Live events are held inside and outside the Academy to help us all to develop, share, and understand this constantly evolving dialogue around terminology. Colleagues, partners and students are invited to join us in a lively, ongoing debate about design research – share your thoughts with us, propose new concepts and provide new examples. 

Details of upcoming Lexicon events will be published on the DAE website, on lexiconofdesignresearch.com and advertised within the school building.

## DESIGN RESEARCH LEXICON TERM OF THE MONTH

→ Serendipity

Noun: the occurrence and development of events by chance, happily or beneficially.

In a design process, designers and design researchers often find something that they were not looking for initially. This also happens at DAE. For serendipity to occur, the ideal condition seems to be an open and questioning attitude in which all the senses participate. 

The concept of serendipity was coined in 1754 by Horace Walpole in reference to The Three Princes of Serendip, a Persian fairy tale in which the heroes ‘were always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of.’ 

These happy occurrences might be discovered by the designer when working iteratively, thinking through making, while analysing their results and then reflecting on them. Intuition is crucial in this process, as is the ability to keep an open mind instead of working directly toward a prescribed result.

Although serendipity has been acknowledged as an important phenomenon – or even a professional capability – in both arts and science, there seems to be no perceptible logic or method to stimulate the achieving of these ‘chance’ results. 

Engaged lingering, walking around without a purpose and idle time spent on or offline, can be beneficial to invoking serendipity; when it occurs, it is immediately recognised as ‘exactly what you need’. 

Although they were not actively being looked for, Teflon, Velcro, nylon, X-rays, penicillin, safety glass, sugar substitutes, polyethene and many other plastics were all discovered ‘by chance’. Serendipity also inspired profound scientific knowledge such as the discovery of DNA. 

Serendipity is often linked to the zeitgeist, which explains findings or inventions occurring at the same time in different places in the world.
