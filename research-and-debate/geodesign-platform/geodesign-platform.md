## EXHIBITION PLATFORM 

GEO—DESIGN explores the social, economic, territorial, and geopolitical forces shaping design today. It generates original research into complex contemporary systems in the form of design explorations and investigations. 

It has transformed the annual exhibition of the Academy’s alumni work – produced in collaboration with the Van Abbemuseum of modern art in Eindhoven – to create an exhibition series that provides an urgently needed space for showcasing experimental approaches to design research.

The first outcome was GEO—DESIGN: Alibaba. in October 2018. Nine DAE graduates were invited to research Alibaba’s operational model and its impact on the design field. GEO–DESIGN: Junk. is the second exhibition in the series.  

“GEO—DESIGN is emblematic of a general shift within the Academy towards focusing on design in terms of systems, strategy, and research,” said Joseph Grima. “The GEO–DESIGN exhibitions program is crucial to the Academy’s ability to build long-term relationships with its alumni, offering them opportunities and encouraging them to continue to engage in research as a part of their professional practice.”

## GEO—DESIGN: COVID-19

Design Academy Eindhoven announces the fourth episode of its [GEO—DESIGN exhibiton platform](https://covid.geodesign.online/): a digital exhibition on the complex dynamics of COVID-19.

The world is currently bearing witness to a virus with unique conditions of contagion that created a pandemic of unexpected scale, ubiquity, and duration. The fragilities of global supply chains were suddenly exposed at their breaking points; the relationships of bodies and spaces drastically changed; perspectives on working arrangements have evolved as digital control systems have become more visible.

GEO—DESIGN: COVID-19. Travelling without moving: a digital journey through the complex manifestations of a global pandemic in the context of late-capitalist society — a chain of original readings that open up an unexpectedly immediate reality marked by acceleration, deceleration and creativity.
