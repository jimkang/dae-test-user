# INTERNATIONAL PRESENTATIONS
Design Academy Eindhoven is an international design school based in the Netherlands. The DAE community encompasses a global network of designers, teachers, curators and makers, many of whom are engaged with live design research projects and the exchange and creation of knowledge within connected fields.

Part of the Academy's vision is to connect this community to a wide variety of audiences and collaborators. The school's international presentations provide an opportunity to put this into action and to share the work of recent graduates and current studios with the world, beyond the annual Graduation Show and specific programmes like those organised through the Geo–Design platform.

DAE regularly stages an exhibition in Milan during the city's annual design week – the world's largest and most important showcase for design – and the school is constantly looking for new opportunities and platforms in other countries.

From 2021, these activities will be gathered here on the DAE website, creating an evolving archive of DAE's international presentations.
