From 5-10 September 2021, DAE participated in Fuorisalone of Salone del Mobile with the exhibition 'Missed Your Call' in a former bakery factory built in 1898, a hidden industrial architecture in the centre of Milan and most of the year closed to the public.

## "Hello?"

## "Hello, can you hear me? Hello?"

Each year, the city of Eindhoven sends out a call to the world, and in October, tens of thousands of people from all over converge there to see the latest work of some of the world’s best designers. The Design Academy’s annual Graduation Show is one of the highlights of the annual Dutch Design Week.

## "Can you hear me? Hello?"

In 2020, nobody answered that call - the world had other matters on its mind.

Now, Milan is returning Eindhoven’s call. The exhibition Missed Your Call is an opportunity for those alumni of Design Academy Eindhoven who graduated from the Bachelors department during the pandemic to show their work to the world. While some projects have evolved and others have kept their original form, they all have in common that they were conceived and produced under bewildering circumstances - circumstances unprecedented in our lifetimes. 

At a time defined by the existential need to “social distance”, proximity is the central element of the curatorial concept of the exhibition, shaping the composition of works within the physical space of the Forni. The work is presented as a meditation on proximity in areas of interest which the designs address, frontiers and approaches to design, as well as larger thematics and discourses. It explores proximities which reflect on individual and collective relationships with our environment, varying habits of consumption, production and distribution, digital and physical realities, narratives and discourses at frontiers of politics, entertainment and image producing industries, as well as design as a tool to create fiction, departing from observations of environmental issues.

Embedded within the exhibition, Het Nieuwe Instituut presents ENTER_Milan, a public programme mediated by events and conversations. Further, there will be a special intervention by Stasis Radio, which originated in 'Moving in Stasis', a collaboration between Master graduates 2020 of Design Academy Eindhoven and Het Nieuwe Instituut earlier this year. 

## "Hello? Hello! That’s much better, I can hear you now."
