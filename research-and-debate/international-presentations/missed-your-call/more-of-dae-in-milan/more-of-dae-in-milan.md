# More of DAE in Milan 2021

## THE LOST GRADUATION SHOW AT SUPERSALONE

The Lost Graduation Show will be a large exhibition bringing together young designers from the Class 2020/21. Curated by Anniina Koivu, on show are about 170 graduation projects, connecting 48 design schools and 200 young designers from 5 continents. Collectively, TLGS constitutes a comprehensive overview of the most pressing topics and questions in contemporary design – questions that the new generation is facing, working on and proposing to solve.

We're happy that eight of our 2020 graduates will be present at this year's Supersalone at Fiera Milano. *Bastiaan Stoker*, *Elsa Molinard*, *Elsa Sier*, *Fiona Herrod*, *Hanna Segerkrantz*, *Paulien Nabben* and *Pollyanna Moss* will exhibit their 2020 graduation projects. We're happy to mention that this production has been made possible with help of our 2020 graduates, especially Hanna Segerkrantz for production.

## ALCOVA/21

Alcova is a platform for independent design developed by Space Caviar and Studio Vedèt. Operating as an itinerant network of exhibition spaces across multiple sites in and around Milan, it activates forgotten locations of historical significance, temporarily recasting them as venues for performative activities. For 2021, the project returns with a new spectacular site - a cluster of buildings immersed in a large urban park. 

Amongst other emerging designers, DAE graduates will present works at the show Alcova/21, at Via Simone Saint Bon 1
Milano, from 4-12 September. *Studio Benjamin Motoc* will show 'Elemental Waltz', *Matilde Patuelli* is presenting the work 'A Story of Control / Control of a Story', *Ignacio Subías Albert* is showing 'Artificial Wasteland', *Ismaël Rifaï and Héloïse Charital* of Studiolow are showing 'Modern Aviaries', alongside *Gianmaria Della Ratta and Giorgio Gasco* of Studio Groovido who are exhibiting 'Castingland'. Further, DAE graduates *Anna Diljá Sigurðardóttir* (2019 graduate) and Studio *Minale-Maeda* (2005 graduate) are exhibiting in the context of 'Brassless' of Nilufar Gallery.
