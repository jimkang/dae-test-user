## Jade Badra → Impact Probes
While social design can create real leverage on critical situations facing society, its impact is not always clear. Impact Probes investigates the question of impact within social design through probing elements. One of them is the online Social Design Hub offering designers to share their frameworks, successes and failures and therefore reflect on their work.

*Jade Badra works as a design researcher, story-teller, and UX Designer. She uses design methods and tools to investigate social issues and construct more inclusive cultural narratives, infrastructures and services. Describing herself as an activist, she is deeply engaged to use her practice as a tool for change.*

## Angéline Behr	→ Imaginary Flower Therapy	
Lack of money, sleep, ideas, fear of failure: this is what Angéline personally experienced during her graduation year, a period of deep anxiety. In her photography book 'Imaginary Flower Therapy’, she presents a method she developed for fighting anxiety, a therapy imagined from floral compositions based on the powers and meanings of flowers.	

*Angéline Behr is a designer specialised in colors, materials, storytelling, set design and photography. Attempting to look at everyday objects differently, she imagines a softer, more inclusive and more cheerful world. Whether in the creation of products or through her photographs, she invites us to discover an experimental, intimate and poetic design.*

## Emy Bensdorp → Packing Up PFAS	
The toxic chemical group PFAS is polluting our environment. It doesn't degrade and is very difficult to clean up because of its attachment to soil. This project offers a solution by transforming PFAS polluted clay soil into bricks. All that remains of the material's dirty past is the stamp stating the location of origin and amount of PFAS removed.	

*Emy Bensdorp combines academic research with her hands-on design approach to create concepts that matter socially and sustainably. Bensdorp materializes her concepts with a keen eye for colour and shape into various forms and products.*

## Charlotte Bombel → Scope
Biologically, humans react to light differently based on colour and height. We therefore require lamps that adapt to a broader range of needs due to the home's evolution into a multifunctional hub for rest, work, and leisure. ‘SCOPE’ is a lamp that creates different light moods by illuminating a multicolored surface.	

*Through light and furniture design, Charlottes Bombel's work explores how the objects and products that surround us reflect ways of living. With a background in biology, she finds ways to combine scientific research with her interest in the sensual and emotional qualities of objects and spaces.*

## Maïté Denolf → Reflective Compass	
A mirror image is not the same as a reflection. We use mirrors to check our appearance, while accidental reflections bring a shift in perspective, a deeper effect on our self-image, reflections can help us understand ourselves and get in touch with our emotions. Observe yourself for a moment.	

*Maïté Denolf is a product designer and interior architect, who allows herself to be surprised by what she sees. Her work revolves around human psychology, the emotional connection with material and environment. Her focus lies on revealing small things that we sometimes take for granted.*

## Arthur Etienne	→ My summer-camp graduation	
Art or design? Male or female? Arthur Etienne proposes a metamorphosis of an iconic school playground item: the scoubidou. Investigating the subjective boundaries between art and design, the installation questions the limits of what is a valid project. The giant scoubidous thus can be seen as a pastiche on the design practice and the status of the creator.	
*Arthur Etienne is eager to explore and produce in various mediums ranging from image and video to sculpture and space. His practice offers a translation of the tensions between the human being and cultural and social systems; the values of which are exemplified through pop culture and technology. With humour and absurdity he develops a retro-futurist aesthetic.*

## Olga Flór	→ Under Cover	
Olga Flór made a drawing named View from the bed, that she developped into weavings. According to her, textile has the ability to instantly metamorphose our surroundings by envelopping objects, transforming the atmosphere, expanding space. This is how these pockets and tapestries create comfort and intimacy, enhancing our relation with our environments.	

*Fascinated by her daily surroundings, Olga Flór explores the potential of existing phenomena and situations by creating particular worlds and new experiences. Her work revolves around textile, metal as well as mechanical and scientific systems as ways to play with our perception of space and time.*

## Jean-Baptiste Gambier	→ Cut, Peel, Stick and Seal!	
By developing his own working method based on the use of duct tape, JB Gambier proposes an alternative way to quickly build objects out of wood and duct tape. Instead of repairing what is broken, the project aims to create a new form language that showcases the playfulness and visual aesthetics of this medium.	

*Working between materiality and digitality, JB Gambier takes fun as a starting point of research and creation, inspired by music, TV shows, movies and video games that entertain him. He builds imaginary worlds which he shapes by using simple materials such as cardboard, tape, wood and scavenged materials.*

## Miles Le Gras → Roofers	
‘Roofers’ is a tribute to the craftmanship of Parisian zinc roofers, who work in a centuries-old tradition. To generate awareness of this craft, which might be recognised as an intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO, Miles Le Gras proposes a series of interior objects using the same tools and materials that the roofers use.	

*Growing up in Paris within an environment heavily influenced by the work of his father – an artist of the ‘Figuration Libre’ movement – Miles Le Gras continues to immerse himself in a colourful, naïve and tactfully playful universe, which triggers our imaginations.*

## Fiona Herrod → stockholmfont.stl	
Fiona Herrod reconfigured ‘stockholm-font.stl’, the 3D file of a plaster font from the Victoria&Albert Museum in London, into a collection of household items. Which opportunities surface when 3D files become widely accessible? Can objects which were once reserved to be displayed by museums be ‘democratised’?	

*Much of Fiona Herrod's work stems from the exploration of the online creative commons: mostly online museum collections, file libraries of 3D scanned artefacts and image archives. Working mainly as a designer and writer, she looks for ways herself and others can interact with or use this open-source content.*

## Pollyanna Moss → Landschaap	
Shepherds maintain biodiversity of the landscape and wellbeing of their flock of sheep while preserving culture. Pollyanna Moss sought to make their contribution manifest by creating blankets from the wool of five breeds of sheep. Each blanket paints an intimate portrait of a shepherd's relationship to the flock and the countryside they inhabit.	

*Pollyanna Moss engages in local practices of crafts and explores their inherent narratives. Her work materialises subjective and complex relationships between humans and the environment through design pieces and video installations, which together provide a careful reading of the landscapes she investigates.*

## Benjamin Motoc → Growth	
Some birthmarks here, some wrinkles there; the object is born from a transformative process that juxtaposes the immiscible materials of wax and water. As the hot wax was poured into an ice mould of 300kg, the mould melted and simultaneously transported its unique reliefs to the produced furniture, which was recast in aluminium.	

*Benjamin Motoc grew up in the suburbs of Paris, where identity politics has fought its way to the forefront of cultural discourse over the last century. With Asian, Romanian and French heritage, he was never sure where to belong. The motifs in Motoc’s conceptual creations extend this search for identity and cultural belonging.*

## Marie Panken	→ Type of Thought	
Can our thoughts be sculpted by a writing tool? Researching the effect of typing on the way we think, Marie Panken created four computer keyboards based on iconic art-movements. Rather than typing as a streamlined production of words, we need tools that enable a rich and layered digital conversation.	

*Marie Panken researches language and its development into digital space. Exploring the transition between analogue and digital, she looks at words as sounds, shapes and movements, creating objects and installations that turn (digital) language into a tangible experience.*	

<mariepanken@gmail.com>	
<https://www.mariepanken.com>	

## Manuel Pellegrini	→ The Graduation Project	
"You cannot sit on it, it doesn’t solve anything and it will never win a design award. It does not work for exposure or recognition." - Follow this interactive audio guide around an empty glass cube and reconsider your worldview and what really matters.	

*Manuel Pellegrini is a passionate experience designer and storyteller. He strongly believes that design should be experienced to convey joyful and/or reflective emotions. In his work he aims to leave an aftertaste of “oh, this was great, I should do more great things in my life”.*

## Ilja Schamlé → Warm Earth	
Look carefully – this server runs on plant and solar energy, the very same energy released by the tomato plants above. In return, the heat from the server sustains the tomato stems, together they form an ecosystem. Can network infrastructures exist together with the living qualities of the atmosphere? How can a parasitic relationship become symbiotic?	

*Ilja Schamlé her practice evolves around the act of remodeling collective imaginaries of the future and norms through co-creation. Investigating the meaning of living with others, humans, non-humans and the non-living.*

## Hannah Segerkrantz → Hemp-it-yourself	
Hemp-it-yourself is a method of working with hempcrete, a versatile and sustainable material that absorbs more CO2 per hectare than any forest or commercial crop. The semi-modular furniture system consists of six shapes which are casted into fabric form-works and can be configured miscellaneously to create objects with various shapes and functions.	

*The notion of agency is central in the work of Hannah Segerkrantz, and goes in parallel with re-defining what we address as our surroundings. With an interest in the intersection between architecture and radical ecology, she offers tools and means for bridging our connection with the environments we inhabit.*

## Nanno Simonis	→ I Am a Screen	
“I served you. I served the image, the data. I was that which channels, not which is. What is shown on my skin no longer acts as my identity, no longer speaks as if it were who I am. I am me now.”	

*Nanno Simonis considers material behaviour as a leading principle by looking for personality, character and narrative within the fabric of our world. Prioritising letting the material speak rather than developing artistic expression, Nanno becomes a passenger within the process of creation.*

## Marwane Soumer	→ Ma’an	
The mantra that form follows function impedes a free an unbiased approach to the act of designing products. This project liberated itself from all formality and conventions taking the shape of a series of water containers, formed and held in the most instinctive possible way. Form follows anatomy. Anatomy creates function.	

*Marwane Soumer's designs are mostly based on intuitive and hand-*scaled objects. He rethinks the way we use products in daily life and is eager to change how we learn to use things, with the aim of creating more instinctive designs.*

## Gundega Strauberga	→ Beachcombers	
Beachcombers are people who clean the shorelines of nets and ropes, a by-product from unsustainable fishing industries. Gundega Strauberga's project represents the future of handcrafted souvenirs, influenced by marine pollution. Products of this new craft belong in a world where extreme aspects of the waste scene have metamorphosed into whole environments.	

*The dialogue between humans and their surroundings has been at the core of Gundega's designs. Particularly interested in tools that respond to changing times, she explores arising frictions in multiple media, plays with meanings and gathers narratives, both real and fictional. Gundega Strauberga is a treasure-hunter-gatherer who tries to continuously redefine what the ‘treasure’ is.*

## Ignacio Subías Albert	→ Artificial Wasteland	
Attempting to challenge our currently established aesthetic ideals about a concept of nature, ‘Artificial Wasteland’ reimagines new versions of the artificial reproduction of grass. States of the lawn presently regarded as ‘ugly’ are carefully reproduced in surfaces made entirely out of plastic.	Ignacio Subías Albert is interested in the study and formulation of images as functional design objects. His work often revolves around the dissection of topics like beauty or visual language, usually involving quiet observation as an integral part of the design process and its outcomes.

## Lola Tual → WC Who Cares	
This toilet-inspired performance cubicle addresses the suffocating effects of peer surveillance in open-plan offices. Instead of the regular use of the restrooms, WC Who Cares allows workers to go on stage, dance, play dress up, and sing along to a selection of songs.	

*Lola Tual's multidisciplinary practice consists of creating interactive decors or visual situations to inspire reflections on social issues. She uses a mix of field research, interviews, photographic documenting and image collecting as inspiration for producing experimental installations, printed editions and visual vocabularies.*

## Bram de Vos → Uprooting Agro-Systems	
Could cities become agriculturally self-sufficient? With Uprooting Agro-Systems, Bram de Vos radically re-envisions Amsterdam as an eco-city of the future. He proposes a combination of three agricultural methods: Syntropic farming, Food forest and Vertical farming. Together, the pros and cons of each are balanced for the best results.	

*The common thread through Bram de Vos' work is to provide answers to the 'pain' cities are facing. As a designer, Bram brings disconnected ideas together into a large overall plan, designing forward-looking urban solutions.*

## Boey Wang → Immeasurable Range	
We are insecure and anxious when our lives are influenced by shifting rules. By hacking four measuring tools, Boey questions the rigid standards that we all tend to follow, even though they confine us and rule out subjectivity. ‘Immeasurable Range’ stretches the laws of physics and introduces a more elastic, less rigid approach.	

*Boey (Bo) Wang explores the sensational and instinctive way of designing through questioning the exclusiveness of our perception. He hacks daily products and implements unusual upgrades. His works attempt to bring us back to a connection with the world without the rigid frameworks of thinking.*

## Nanyoung Yoon → Direct/ Indirect	
Direct/ Indirect is a revolving shelf which was developed from the observation of a sense of anxiety which Nanyoung has known all his life. An open shelter which he can hide in, this optical illusion will be a pathway to escape into a reflected space.	

*Contrast is Nanyoung's inspiration. Direct and indirect, light and shadow, bold and delicate, blunt and stimulate, minimal and maximal. With respect to the rules, there are no rules.*

## Teun Zwets	→ Teunland	
“Creating is almost like therapy to me, these objects visualise my thoughts and feelings.” ‘Teunland’ is an expression of the mind of Teun Zwets. "When I work with my hands the mind gets triggered." From previous objects new objects are born, solutions to problems generate visual outcomes, generating a mix of ready prototypes and functional art objects. 	

*Teun Zwets is a maker to the bone. His creations are made on the spot with no time to lose and from materials that are available on site. The speed of his process is crucial. Welcome to ‘Teunland’, the fascinating world that represents his agile brain.*
