# PUBLIC PROGRAMME

At the invitation of Design Academy Eindhoven, Het Nieuwe Instituut, together with the DAE graduates 2020, has created an online public programme to reflect on the current state of the design field and the challenges ahead. 

The programme marks the first public appearance of Enter, an online meeting and event platform initiated by Het Nieuwe Instituut. Enter combines experimental digital design, web development and critical reflection in pursuit of the goal of building a more independent, privacy- and human-friendly alternative to the standard online platforms. 

While continuously in development, Enter provides an intimate and flexible online space for conversations and small-scale events. On this occasion, Enter also transforms into an interior, creating a hybrid environment for meetings between people in Milan and elsewhere. 

ENTER_Milan includes five days of readings, explorations, interviews, discussions and presentations by and with designers, writers, curators, educators, students and others working in design.

With this programme during Salone, Het Nieuwe Instituut aims to reach out to all students and designers in Milan and elsewhere and invite them to contribute their thinking on the present moment and immediate future. Building spaces of exchange, solidarity and commonality is paramount for facing the challenges and responsibilities that lie ahead for designers and institutions connected to the design field.
