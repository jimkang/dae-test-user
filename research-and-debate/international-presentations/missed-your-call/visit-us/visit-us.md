DAE's public events follow the recommendations of the Italian government. Therefore, we ask all visitors of Missed Your Call to wear a mask covering nose and mouth. At the entrance to the exhibition, you'll be asked to show the Italian Green Pass, a proof of vaccination (at least 14 days after the first shot) or a negative Corona test result (not older than 72 hours). Please keep a distance to other visitors out of courtesy and to prevent infection. Thank you.
