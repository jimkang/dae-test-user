# INTRODUCTION TO ARCHITECTURE BY JOS DELBROEK
The methodology of the course 'Introduction to Architecture' in the propaedeutic year of the Design Academy Eindhoven, deals with three different topics: 'Reading Architecture’, 'Architectural Experience' and 'Architectural Design'.

In this first package, my intention is to help students to read architecture, and to read about architecture as well. It consists of a series of lectures given by myself, for which I rely on Steen Eiler Rasmussen's book Experiencing Architecture, Boston: MIT, 1962. These lectures deal with the basic principles of architecture; incidentally, they naturally provide information about graphic communication in architecture, which should help the students to realise plans, heights, cross-sections and models for the architectural design.
In the course of the lectures, students are expected to write an 'Inspiration Book', in which they themselves proceed to further research on topics discussed.

For these various lectures, I work with the following titles/points of interest: 

 1. Comfort, Context and Definitions of Architecture
 2. Reading a plan, drawing a plan, and drawing in three dimensions
 3. Scale, size and proportion in the human body
 4. Geometric proportions
 5. Proportioning systems with Le Corbusier and Dom Hans Van der Laan 
 6. Architecture for all senses
 7. Light and colour in architecture

During the period that the lectures take place, students also go on a study trip to a historic city to experience the historical and contemporary architecture in practice. This study trip forms the second method: 'Architecture experience'. Examples of such trips are Brussels (B), Gent and Waasmunster (B) and Insel Hombroich Neuss Germany.

Students are expected to make a report of the study trip and to combine text, images, drawings and photographs on the basis of observation, registration and communication.

For the third topic of the course, 'Architectural design', the students work out a simple housing project in the Dutch context of community life and high population density.
