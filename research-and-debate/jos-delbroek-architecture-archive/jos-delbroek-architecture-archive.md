# JOS DELBROEK TEACHING ARCHIVE
 
After 35 years of teaching architecture at Design Academy Eindhoven, Jos Delbroek is leaving the Academy. As a legacy to the DAE community, Delbroek made [a digital archive of teaching materials](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/research-and-debate/introduction-to-architecture-(jos-delbroek)) accessible and contributed a collection of books on architecture and technical drawing to the Academy’s library, which constitute a resource to current and future students of Design Academy. 
 
Leaving the Academy after his decades long journey of teaching, Delbroek recollects that acquainting students with the discipline of architecture was certainly his biggest achievement at DAE, as some of his students evolved to study architecture after graduating from the Academy and are now working for large architectural offices. Delbroek describes his lectures and assignments as continuously structured around his concept of ‘good design’, which brings together functionality, aesthetics and ethics. 
 
Reflecting on his biggest challenges as a teacher, Delbroek speaks about the growing size of groups of students over the years and the resulting challenge to communicate with students in a personal manner. He describes flexibility as a particular trait that helped him on the journey of teaching at Design Academy, as he witnessed structures and people change over the years. 
 
While he’s “happy and proud” to have worked at DAE for an extensive period, Delbroek contemplates recent developments at the Academy and hopes that DAE will keep to teach “good design [as] based on sobriety, simplicity, efficiency and [making] a virtue of necessity.”
