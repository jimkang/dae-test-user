# DAE LIBRARY

## The Design Academy Eindhoven Library is an integral resource, with a rich and continually updated collection of books, magazines, journals and more.

---

The DAE Library is small, but densely packed with information and inspiration. Librarian Evi Piepers can advise students on how to access the library’s collection of more than 10,000 books to find relevant readings for their research. The variety of texts available includes key theoretical titles, essay collections and series on a wide range of subjects and types of knowledge.

The Library also houses a collection of exhibition catalogues, monographs and practical manuals that are of special interest to designers. The collection is currently mainly English language-based, with limited texts in a variety of other languages.

Students can also access the latest issue and archive editions of more than 60 international magazines, ranging from the Harvard Design Magazine – which explores the role of design in society – to Spanish interiors and interviews title Apartamento, American photography magazine Aperture and respected Italian architecture title Domus.

Students are encouraged to use the Library to develop and strengthen their critical practice, widen their perspective, understand the historical context of their work, and engage with ideas beyond the walls of the institution.

Located on the second floor of the Academy building, the library is close to the Digital Workshop, where students can use the scanning and photocopying facilities.

The entire library catalogue can be browsed remotely in English, Dutch and French at [library.designacademy.nl](https://library.designacademy.nl/)
