# CRITICAL DIVERSITY CONFERENCE
18 - 19 October 2021 , Beursgebouw Eindhoven

Diversity and inclusivity are urgent topics that are too often used to make institutions look good, instead of being used as tools to truly enable a sense of belonging. This urgent topic within art and design education is being addressed in the Critical Diversity Conference at the Graduation Show. The conference is organised and led by Dr Praveen Sewgobind, as part of the Diversity & Inclusion Professorship.

The two-day event included keynote lectures and panel discussions following three themes — Breathing, Becoming and Belonging. The intention is to stimulate theories and practices that can transform cultures that create an unequal distribution of power and privilege in higher education and wider society. 

Amongst the speakers were Kaylee Rosalina, Eline Pollaert, Aminata Cairo and Tingting Hui. Each speaker and panellist bringing an expert point of view on the wide topic of diversity.

## Speakers 

Praveen Sewgobind 

Dr. Praveen Sewgobind is an activist-academic working to deepen and complicate Critical Race Theory with a decolonial lens, focusing on the embodiment of social constructs of racial formation in the Netherlands. He holds a doctorate degree in cosmopolitanism (University of Potsdam) and a master’s degree in Cultural Analysis (University of Amsterdam).  

Praveen is currently a research professor working to strengthen diversity and inclusivity at the Design Academy Eindhoven. There, he has initiated and coordinates the Social Justice Lab: a hub-in-progress dedicated to furthering discussion, action and, consequently, tangible results. He stresses that it is vital to go beyond window-dressing characteristics of diversity politics by assessing and critiquing structures of power and privilege that give rise to a lack of diversity and inclusivity.  

Having participated in social movements in several parts of the world, Praveen’s motivation is fuelled by experiences of social injustice as well as by bold attempts to dismantle the unequal distribution of resources, power, and privilege.

Evans moved to the Netherlands from London where she collaborated with artists to produce works across multiple disciplines and spaces including gallery exhibitions and screenings, site-specific theatre and performances, community organizing, and audio and video production. Through this work and her research, she seeks to elevate excluded narratives and to create opportunities for publics to critically engage power structures that shape our everyday.

Round Table - nation-wide diversity and inclusion network

The urgency to create networks, discussion, and action diversity and inclusivity has led to a new initiative that has taken shape over the summer of 2021. A network of arts and design schools, united in the Overleg Beeldende Kunsten (OBK), has taken up the urgency to “walk the walk” in terms of diversity and inclusion which has resulted in the creation of a nation-wide Round Table.

Practitioners and specialists working on diversity and inclusion from many Dutch institutions regularly meet and inform one another about local initiatives, stimulate action and debate, and talk about ways to truly change arts and design institutions in terms of social safety. At the Critical Diversity Conference they will present themselves and share their commen goals.
Represented by: Siela Ardjosemito-Jethoe, Izzy Ramos, Charlotte Wekker & Chequita Nahar.
