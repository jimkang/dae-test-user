# DIVERSITY & INCLUSIVITY

Diversity and inclusivity are urgent topics that are too often used to make institutions look good, instead of being used as tools to truly enable a sense of belonging. This sense of belonging is fundamental for real inclusivity and diversity. Unless they are welcomed in a social context, those who have traditionally been marginalised will struggle to have a place at the table in the shifting dynamics of cities.

With an Indian, Surinamese and Dutch cultural background, Dr Praveen Sewgobind is an activist-academic researcher, working to further diversity and ethnicity theory in the Netherlands. His research at Design Academy Eindhoven will focus on theorising and materialising the conditions for inclusivity and diversity.

Dr Sewgobind’s work catalyses instruments, like pedagogical strategies, that underscore the necessity of ‘walking the walk’. For example the ‘walkshop’, a critical educational experience whereby participants become actors and engage with the real world. They combine practical and theoretical tools and contribute to the idea of the city as a place for cross-pollination and learning rather than exclusion and superficiality. He sees his work as inextricably connected to addressing configurations of power and privilege as exemplified by contributing to the current ERIF (European Race & Imagery Foundation) campaign.
