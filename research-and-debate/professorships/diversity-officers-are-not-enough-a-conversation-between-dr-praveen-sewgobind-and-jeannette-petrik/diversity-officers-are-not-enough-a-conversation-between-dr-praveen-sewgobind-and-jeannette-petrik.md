# Diversity Officers Are Not Enough
## A conversation between Dr Praveen Sewgobind, Professor of Diversity & Inclusivity at Design Academy Eindhoven, and Jeannette Petrik

---

In his research at Design Academy Eindhoven, activist-academic researcher Praveen Sewgobind aims to contribute to dismantling exclusion by embracing structural diversity in the context of the city. Cities have traditionally been loci power and privilege, as well as sites where their unequal distribution has been contested and dismantled. 

The framework and drive for research in his Professorship at DAE focusses on theorising and materialising the conditions for inclusivity and diversity. Diversity and inclusivity are urgent topics that are too often used to make institutions look good, instead of being used as tools to truly enable a sense of belonging. This sense of belonging is fundamental for real inclusivity and diversity. Unless they are welcomed in a social context, those who have traditionally been marginalised will struggle to have a place at the table in the shifting dynamics of cities. His research catalyses instruments that underscore the necessity of ‘walking the walk’. 

Jeannette Petrik met Dr Praveen Sewgobind virtually at the end of January 2021 to talk about the professorship on Inclusivity and Diversity at Design Academy Eindhoven, community-based steps towards institutional reforms and empathy. The below transcript of the conversation has been edited collectively.

→ Jeannette Petrik: 'Diversity' has become a buzzword that’s increasingly popping up in a variety of contexts. Still, it feels like a state that we are yet to achieve. 

→ Dr Praveen Sewgobind: What you point to is a common feeling among people who are engaged with diversity politics. There is always a tension between the theoretical policy aspect and the reality of what it means for people and within their social contexts. The word 'diversity' distracts the attention from the issue at hand. The issue is, in fact, that there is in an unequal distribution of resources, privileges and power and this creates a hierarchy, an unequal situation.  

The goal is to start communicating about what people actually want and to do it in a language that is clear. To start the discussion with diversity is a step too far, I think. I would, personally, start with social justice as a concept and then look at how that would fit into an academy or an institution. 

→ JP: We're still lacking language and tools to address inequalities without projecting or experiencing blame or guilt, I feel. As a community of people with different social and cultural backgrounds, what can we do to challenge our routines and restructure realities of inequality? 

→ PS: We need to realise that, in general, we are all part of social categories. Some groups, historically, have more advantages than others, such as middle class or upper middle class white men, who have been in certain positions of power. The issue is not to blame individuals, of course, but to create an awareness of how this system works. When you talk about equality and justice you have to acknowledge that certain people have more privileges than others. It would be better for the whole organisation if there would be more awareness about this, to start with. 

The sense that people take it personally is oftentimes something very real and emotional, because we're dealing with issues of racism, sexism and the structures of unequal power that are already operating. We talk about diversity politics but the conversation is often triggered by these experiences of being treated wrongly, of feeling that you're being discriminated against and that you don’t get the same opportunities as other people. The point is to acknowledge these realities and to not see this conversation as based on competitive forces, but as a means to go forward. 

There's two layers to this: The future, and the reality on the ground, which needs to change. I guess, there's a sense of fear around the topic of diversity. A fear amongst certain people that things have to change now, and their positions might be at stake, but the question should be 'Why hasn't societal power been distributed more evenly?' When we start to talk about this, to communicate and actually create empathy, that's the key point, that's where things can start to change. To communicate is to have empathy for the other's position.

→ JP: What have your experiences in other contexts been like, where conversations around social justice and diversity have more of a tradition? 

→ PS: We can learn from other countries where diversity politics have been more at the forefront for a longer time, especially the US and the UK. There's a danger that diversity politics might not affect anything other than the perception. An institution's diversity office might organise events but these might not create structural change. One of the theorists who has been working on this for a long time, Sara Ahmed, pointed to this danger which could be referred to as 'the circulatory effect'. The challenge is to make diversity politics into a structural process, rather than just an issue of perception. 

People who demand changes want to see some real, practical and tangible changes coupled with a true sense of belonging. One thing we can learn from the history of diversity politics is to be aware that it should be about real, tangible change. We need to question what lies behind that. Is that diversity we see in the advertisement reflected in the whole structure, in the management team, among the teachers, among the students? That's a challenge which emerges in every institution. 

→ JP: Do you have concrete plans for your professorship at Design Academy? 

→ PS: Right now, I'm organising a series of events that tap into the idea of critical diversity, of real diversity. Further, I'll be organising a seminar series, mainly for teachers, to give a deeper understanding of diversity politics, but importantly, anti-racism, anti-sexism, and how these concepts interrelate. Here, I apply insights gained through my academic research on critical race theory to stimulate a better understanding of race and racism. It's important to start a thorough discussion. The seminars will culminate in a conference, where people can showcase work on diversity and inclusion. From there, the plan is to have ongoing discussions. That's another lesson we've learned: If there's no follow up, there's no permanence. I want to create a more embedded structure for discussion that results from the conference. It should be a process where people can learn and communicate, be empathetic, but then also work towards some real changes.  

For example, institutions can critically look at the way people are hired and the way students are being attracted. They can also challenge where and how they publish. And, what about the curriculum? What about the books you use? Who has written these books? Which traditions does your curriculum come from? Those issues are the structural points to look at and to work on continuously.  

The challenge is to create a situation where we can actually learn to see the grievances of people by attaining a position where you can be empathetic and not only see your point of view. One of the main ways to do that, which is a principle of critical race theory, is to question how to change dominant knowledge systems. This can mean engaging in counter storytelling and counter narratives to create a situation where people can read stories or learn about the experiences of other people, of people of colour, of women, a whole range of people who are underrepresented. It's important to listen to these stories, as a start. 

→ JP: Can one learn to be empathetic? 

→ PS: We should go into the social psychology of the concept of empathy and, actually because all is interconnected. As human beings, our behavioural patterns are connected. This is a difficult process because empathy seems to be at tension with your individual self, your own ideas, your own way to go forward. The individualist approach in society is pretty dominant. To, then, have empathy might require telling yourself that in a particular situation, it's not you who should be at the forefront and to, instead, learn to see the other person and their potential. When you're focused only on yourself, what then makes you want to see the other and makes you lower your own individual status? Despite the ideology of individualism, we are social beings. We need other people to live. We can become more empathetic through interesting courses, programs, anecdotes, stories or you can visualise it to stimulate an interest.  

→ JP: What about tokenism? 

→ PS: Tokenism is a very real issue and people take different positions on it. The problem is that when, say, a woman of colour is able to get a position in an organisation that is predominantly white and male, she could feel as if she were a token that is being used and displayed as such towards the outside world. It's difficult to deal with that, especially when you're on your own or with a small group of people. That's when this sense of tokenism really emerges because it is you against the rest and everybody is looking at you. To be honest, I've been in such situations myself, for many years, and I think the only way to solve the situation is by finding other people and creating a network to talk about these issues and find ways to go forward. You'll notice that you're not alone and you'll be working towards a common goal. 

We need to realise that these hierarchies, these power structures create structural inequality. Violence, not only physical, is an inherent part of this. I am very keen to show that we are part of a system but we're also able to change the system. I'm working to counter sexism but I also realise that it's not genuine for me – because of the forces of socialisation – to say 'I'm not sexist', because it's a process to become aware of how these oppressive mechanisms have informed our lives from the moment we were born. A humble and open approach is necessary to open people's eyes.  

We're up against the notion that you have to push yourself as an individual to achieve your goals, which can be good because it motivates you, but it also puts you in a position of competition with other people.

→ JP: Are educational institutions breeding grounds for competitive thinking? 

→ PS: More than wanting to abolish competition in general, it's the personal competition between people what hinders us from seeing the other side. There's a clear demand that institutions become more diverse, more reflective of the world we live in. Everybody knows that we cannot continue the way we have done. Because these developments are happening everywhere, there's a certain pressure.  

It’s difficult to distance ourselves completely from, say, sexism or racism because these structures are everywhere in society, and we are informed and influenced by them. It's just a humble position to take when working towards dismantling these inequalities. We're not beyond these structures because we still live in them. 

→ JP: Why do you choose to work on social issues specifically at a design school? 

→ PS: Because of my activist background, I'm keen to always look at theory on the one hand, but also at practice, at what is currently happening. The academic world, that is, classical universities are mainly focused on theory. I think it's just fascinating to look at how theory and practice can intermingle. Universities of the arts are spaces where exactly that happens. For instance, buildings and infrastructure relate to, or, influence social structures and identities because a building is not just a building. It’s a reflection of a certain culture. In the end, it is not only about changing the ways we are within an institution, but it's about changing society. When you open up the institution to people who have historically not been part of the institution, there are more ways to learn about society and to cross-pollinate ideas.  

→ JP: What are you currently most eager to address? 

→ PS: Right now, it’s important for me to get to know people at every level. It will be interesting to learn from others and to understand how they cope with the situation of social distancing. It's a challenge to practice social distancing and community building at the same time. In a digital space, it’s important to talk to one another about this and to give each other ideas and tips. The measures are also having an effect on our mental health. That’s something we should not underestimate. I'm keen to learn about how we can create a sense of community despite the terrible situation we are in. Let's just hope that the measures can be revoked as soon as possible and people can actually meet one another in-real-life again.  

Moreover, I will initiate and coordinate a DAE Social Justice Lab, a site - hopefully a physical space - where students and staff can work on concrete goals, reflecting social justice struggles. This needs to be a safe space where especially those who have been marginalised historically, can meet and feel empowered. Central to my vision of a critical diversity practice is that necessary pairing of "talking the talk" with "walking the walk." 

Groups are a reflection of the social structure. It is to be expected that we will carry these inequalities, our prejudices and biases with us. One of the things people are confronted with during diversity training is to be aware of group dynamics: who gets to speak, who gets to speak first, who gets to speak for which amount of time, at what volume, etc. These are important issues to be aware of because there are often deficits between people of different genders and cultural backgrounds. This is just something that I've seen in many organisations. People might say that they are committed to diversity, but then they will be the first ones to talk during a meeting or ask a question. Sometimes it would be good if people would just step back and think ‘You know what, maybe I'll wait, maybe I won't be the first to ask a question,’ ‘Maybe I should really give a woman of colour an opportunity to speak first.’ We should be aware of these mechanisms. 

We need have the audacity to change things. We know that this is an issue that is contentious and difficult, full of tension. We might be tempted not to critique or not to speak out against something to avoid going against the grain. But, in order to change things, it's just necessary to open up and to address what we perceive is wrong. The more people who do that, the easier it gets. 

Sometimes people ask me why I have chosen to deal with this topic. It’s difficult and frustrating but I know that it can make a difference if you can stimulate people to, for example, enter into education and thereby change the power and privilege dynamic. When we can lower the hurdles, and find ways to overcome glass ceilings or brick walls, then this would be better for all. Audacity is important and for that you need people who speak out, and they will become role models on their own. 

Through my experiences abroad, I can tap into experiences that I try to rework and implement right now. That's my motivation. It's easy to give up, to dwell in your misery and frustration and anger. I know how this works. I'm not going to tell people not to be angry because I know where this emotion comes from and feel this myself. I've experienced racism and exclusion all my life, so, this is very real to me. It's important to acknowledge these experiences while also seeking a way to transform anger and frustration into something worthwhile. That's the difficult part.

In November 2020, the Research Department of Design Academy Eindhoven launched three professorships, which form the core of a new research programme pivoting around the notion of Becoming. This programme is articulated through three interconnected strands: Diversity & Inclusion, Transdisciplinary Design Networks, and The Non-School. The professorships will be spearheaded by Dr Praveen Sewgobind, Dr Ian Biscoe and Dr Annika Frye. 

The Becoming programme responds to a need for us to re-examine how both human and non-human actors can have a perpetual and meaningful agency in effecting change. The sensation of continuous transformation, exciting and terrifying at the same time, calls on us to rethink every aspect of our existence, from the simplest to the most complex. Becoming requires inventiveness, coordination and empathic abilities. The scale of the challenges that lie ahead require concerted efforts from across the disciplinary spectrum and the switch that needs to be made is often radical.
