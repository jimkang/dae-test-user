# RESTSTROMEN PROJECT
DAE project team: Lucas Zoutendijk, Ester van de Wiel

Partner: Waterboard De Dommel

Reststromen translates as ‘residual flows’ in English. This project focussed on the ‘restromen’ waste flows of Waterboard De Dommel, the Dutch government’s water network, which has a longstanding relationship with DAE.

Researcher Lucas Zoutendijk collaborated closely with the experts from the water board to find ways to make the problem of waste more visible.

He created a visual language that made the waste flows easier to discuss, exposing the matter that they contain, from coffee grounds to cuttings and phosphates.

This project demonstrates the power of design research, visualising a complex issue and making it more accessible, enabling important discussions and decision-making.

Restromen’s success resulted in a second project, which began in 2020.
