Research is a crucial aspect of education at Design Academy Eindhoven. As well as playing a significant role in the work produced by our students on an individual basis, it also has a dedicated department. 

The Research Department is a centre for excellence in the field of Design Research and encompasses the Academy’s research Professorships. These focus on collaborative, research-driven and interdisciplinary projects around specific themes or subjects, bringing together teams of specialists and researchers from academia, industry and the design community. 

Flexible and responsive, the department tackles a range of subject and undertakes a wide variety of projects to reflect the latest thinking and concerns within the school, as well as global events, crises and challenges. It also spearheads collective, collaborative projects within the Academy, as well as with other institutions and organisations.

## New Cycle of Professorships

In November 2020, DAE launched a new series of Professorships, building on the success of the previous [Places & Traces](https://designacademy.nl/p/research-and-debate/professorships/places-and-traces) and [Strategic Creativity](https://designacademy.nl/p/research-and-debate/professorships/strategic-creativity) Professorships, which concluded in 2020 and 2019. 

Together, the Professorships form the core of a new research programme, which will pivot around the notion of Becoming. This programme is articulated through three interconnected strands: Diversity & Inclusion, Transdisciplinary Design Networks and The Non-School. The professorships will be spearheaded by Dr Praveen Sewgobind, Dr Ian Biscoe and Dr Annika Frye.

## Becoming

The relatively brief history of human presence on Earth has been characterised by a constant state of transition, and in recent times this transition has gathered speed. Accelerated evolution seems to envelop every aspect of our lives. In our work, in our social relationships, in our creative pursuits, in our struggle to survive on a planet under threat from our own past and present activities, we are constantly pursued by the sense that transition is inevitable. 

This sensation of continuous transformation, exciting and terrifying at the same time, calls on us to rethink every aspect of our existence, from the simplest to the most complex. The Becoming programme responds to a need for us to reexamine how both human and non-human actors can have a perpetual and meaningful agency in effecting change. 

Becoming will require inventiveness, coordination and empathic abilities. The scale of the challenges that lie ahead require concerted efforts from across the disciplinary spectrum and the switch that needs to be made is often radical. 

We see the role of the designer as important in giving form, but even more important in managing processes of complexity. As individuals, businesses, governments, non-profits and institutions all struggle to find alternatives to impending crises, there is a desperate need for professionals who are capable of bringing together, structuring collaboration, and unpicking the stratified problematics of organisational practice. 

We see the designer as a non-individualist capable of multiplying their own knowledge and skills through the knowledge and skills of others, making the previously unthinkable possible. Alumni of DAE are known for their open and curious attitude, for not being afraid to allow space for doubt, and for enabling openness in the outcome rather than aiming for fixed results. They are designers able to contribute to today’s challenges in a contextual and multi-species oriented approach, contributing to the construction of a just, diverse and non-extractive economy and society. 

This is the ethos that will drive the new cycle of Professorships at DAE. Their work will be made public on the DAE website in a variety of formats and more information about the programme will emerge as the three strands develop.
