# EMPATHY THROUGH A LENS
Project author: Maartje van Gestel

Empathy Through a Lens was part of the Grey but Mobile project. It explored the use of documentary photography as an accessible means for communicating personal stories and perspectives as tools for design teams and other professionals. When

design research seeks to explore, analyse and present social issues through documentary photography, it can reveal many perspectives. These photographs can enable useful conversations with the subjects of a project. This publication discusses what is needed to create empathic pictures and how their analysis can benefit design teams.
