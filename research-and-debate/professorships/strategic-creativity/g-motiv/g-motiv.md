# G-MOTIV
DAE project team: Alessia Cadamuro and Susana Cámara Leret

Design Motivation – Changing Human Behaviour Using Game Elements (G-MOTIV) was about researching and applying new approaches to foster behavioural change by using game elements as a form of motivation. Achieving lasting change is difficult; people are often poorly motivated to change their status quo. in healthcare and human resources, this often leads to large financial costs for society and organisational costs for companies. Current tools used to ‘help’ people change include therapy, training and coaching, but the results are often short term.

The G-MOTIV team developed intelligent PSS prototypes in the fields of health care and human resources. Using knowledge evolving from the gaming industry. Fantasy, challenge and action consequences are known to be powerful tools for motivation.
