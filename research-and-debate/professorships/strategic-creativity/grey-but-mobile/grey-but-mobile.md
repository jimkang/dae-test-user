# GREY BUT MOBILE
DAE project team members: Heather Daam and Maartje van Gestel

Grey but Mobile is an alternate name for the project Enhanced Care Service Through Improved Mobility for Elderly People. The project focussed on improving care-related mobility services for the elderly to support independent living and social connectivity.

Elderly people are living in their own homes for longer, predominantly due to improvement in at-home care. This is considered a positive development in regards to efficiency and cost but has downsides. Elderly people often live alone and solitude is a key factor in many health issues. Remaining mobile enables social connection and involvement, but existing mobility solutions do not cater specifically to this group.

Mobile-care projects have been initiated in the context of organisations and services. A major constraint is the availability of dedicated vehicle designs and interfaces between services and the means of mobility. A new class of vehicles is envisaged that will specifically address the needs of this age group, matching their environmental, physical, mental and social needs.

This project brought together teams from three universities and industry partners to examine key questions around the development of mobility solutions for elderly people.

Grey but Mobile was carried out within CRISP (Creative Industry Scientific Programme), a multi-partner initiative focussing on Product Service Systems.
