# GRIP
DAE project team: Mike Thompson

GRIP is an alternate name for the project Flexibility Versus Control in the Design of Product Service Systems. Part of CRISP, GRIP investigated how designers find a balance between control and flexibility when designing PSS, leading to the creation of effective and socially responsible value for users and stakeholders.

When designing from a systems perspective, creative control of design is structurally lower than in product design. Designers must deal with complex, dynamic environments and negotiate decisions with a range of stakeholders. The PSS development process is characterised by a high level of co-creation and co-production, meaning designers must work with other creators while remaining sensitive to the needs of development partners and end-users.
