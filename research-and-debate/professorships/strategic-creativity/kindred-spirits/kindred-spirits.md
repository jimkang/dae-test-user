# KINDRED SPIRITS
Project author: Susana Cámara Leret

Designing with young addicts and health-care professionals requires a deep

understanding of the everyday situations they face, especially when the anticipated designs aim to explore more speculative approaches and uncharted territories.

Kindred Spirits brought together a wide range of perspectives in one publication, looking at how the design of a set of smells influenced patient treatment and how the design of fictional ‘companion species' allowed people within a clinic to see and discuss their daily environment in new ways.
