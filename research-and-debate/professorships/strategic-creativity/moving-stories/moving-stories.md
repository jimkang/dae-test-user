# MOVING STORIES
Project author: Heather Daam

Moving Stories was part of the Grey but Mobile project. This book demonstrates how empathy enables designers to explore and question key issues, rather than just sympathise with their situations. Such in-depth understanding is crucial for the generation of useful ideas in many areas of design, including developing mobility solutions for older people. How can designers deploy their empathic skills to support innovators at care organisations towards developing new services?
