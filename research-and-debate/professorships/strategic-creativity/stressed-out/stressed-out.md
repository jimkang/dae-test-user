# STRESSED OUT
Project author: Mike Thompson

One outcome of the GRIP project, Stressed Out focussed on the idea of developing a PPS that targeted work-related stress. The publication takes a critical approach to data-led services that have risen to prominence in personal healthcare, with the growing popularity and data harvesting of devices such as smartwatches and smartphones. It questions what is being measured and who controls the data, what it tells us, and how this data can be used to support society positively. It assesses the role of GRIP as a service for the health and stress industries.
