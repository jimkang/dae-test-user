# STS
DAE project team: Michelle Baggerman

STS is the abbreviated title for Smart Textile Services, which focusses on the designing and selling of smart textile product systems.

Combining soft materials with high technology has led to the creation of ‘smart textiles’ – interactive materials that can, by using sensors and actuators, collect data or influence user behaviour. This opens up a multitude of possibilities for application in PSS in the fields of societal care, productivity and lifestyle. It is of strategic importance for the European textile industries to explore these possibilities to sustain

their competitive edge.

The goal of STS is to integrate existing knowledge from the separate domains of textile, technology and service and generate new knowledge about methods and tools for integrations. This will be achieved by conducting research through design in multi-stakeholder groups in an inspirational test-bed, where new smart textile PSS can be created and tested.
