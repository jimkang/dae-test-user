# SUPER-MAKER
Project author: Karianne Rygh

Super-Maker focussed on ways to use new printing technology developed by Océ, a Canon company, exploring the functional possibilities of a tool with a thinking-through-making approach that generated a range of material explorations and workshops. Bringing together the technology, designers, company experts, professional amateurs and businesses, the name Super-Maker reflected the need to bring ‘makers’ together in open collaboration to power the project.
