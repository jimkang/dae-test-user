# THE PLAY'S THE THING
Project author: Jonathan Wray

Designs are no longer merely the producers of products but are designing services and systems around complex problems. This is a new landscape, in which designers become strategists at the front-end of innovation processes.

This publication discusses Strategic Service Design, attempting to make sense of this new design landscape through the format of a play. A well-crafted play involves people, a good plot and fine props. Similarly, products, services and people need to be connected strategically to enable the effective design of Product Service Systems.

Led by research associate Jonathan Wray, The Play’s the Thing was part of the CASD project.
