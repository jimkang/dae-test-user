# VALUE PURSUIT
Project author: Karianne Rygh

Designers are usually trained to follow briefs and solve problems, but what happens when the contexts they work in become so complex that there is no clear problem to be solved yet it's obvious that some kind of change is needed? These so-called 'wicked' problems need to be tackled at both an organisational and a network level for designers to become the instigators of the change that is required. Value Pursuit aimed to shed some light on what kind of support, approaches and mindsets designers require to do so. The project created a workshop tool for fostering understanding and maintaining trust in networked collaboration.
