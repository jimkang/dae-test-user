# WHAT REMAINS?
Project author: Alessia Cadamuro

The number of people suffering from Dementia is growing rapidly. What Remains? was a design research project that aimed to stimulate positive behavioural changes in the elderly affected by this disease and help family and staff to humanise care services.

Product Service Systems require designers to think and work more broadly and more strategically in response to societal challenges. When these 'grand challenges' have implications in people's lives, empathy, respect and humility are crucial capabilities for designers. The dignity of the people they work with is the foundation for a strategic impact. An empathetic co-design approach can generate important value.
