# THE NON-SCHOOL

## A conversation with Dr Annika Frye

---

[Dr Annika Frye](https://designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/community/dr-annika-frye) is a designer, researcher, design theorist and educator interested in the fields of experimental industrial design, the aesthetics of serial production and interfaces as post-digital, hybrid spaces between the digital and the analogue. She recently joined DAE as part of the newly reshaped research department, where she is [researching changing processes within design education](https://www.annikafrye.de/portfolio/non-school-professorship-at-design-academy-eindhoven/), focussing on the qualities of digital materiality in the intersection of design, art and technology. 

An expert in Open Design—which, in the context of design processes, breaks up hierarchies by creating a network of actors—Dr Frye is exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education and investigating how to apply the strategies of Open Design to further develop digital learning in design. Her Professorship responds to and anticipates the next stage of an extraordinarily fertile culture of fully or partly remote learning and online or blended education programmes. It aims to recognise learning as 'becoming'—the core notion behind DAE's current research programme—using technology as an instrument of evolution and democratisation of design education. To find out more about the Becoming programme, see the column on the right of this page, or read on for a conversation between Dr Frye and Jeannette Petrik, one of the members of the DAE Editorial Team.

Jeannette Petrik: Your professorship is called The Non–School. Is this a hint towards a desire to change the character of Design Academy Eindhoven?

Dr Annika Frye: The Non-School is a generative metaphor for a different way of considering what a school is. I'm interested in experimenting with approaches to teaching in digital spaces. The digital spaces we currently inhabit could be less hierarchical and more participatory. Essentially, I want to explore changing education via Open Design and use digitality, with an approach that I understand to be similar to revolutionary moments within manufacturing, such as 3D-printing opening up production processes. 

Initially, my plan was to establish a platform to help people communicate better, but now, I'm approaching the topic from various angles. I want to create hybrid spaces for sharing. I want to explore teaching methodologies and also contribute to teaching practices at DAE. I have been talking to other teachers about giving input and contributing knowledge for my field of interest. 
 
The Non-School originates in my experience with art schools, which are often very conservative. Not being able to enter some of these schools’ buildings during the pandemic brought something unexpected, which became an opportunity to discover what hinders us in education. A school's building is modelled according to certain hierarchies, often reproducing traditional teaching styles. Online teaching brought the potential to shape digital spaces differently, but it turned out to resemble conservative processes. I would like to overcome that. The true quality of a school lies in social encounters and all those creative things that happen.

JP: It sounds like you want to change the educational system from within, rather than abolish it. From your experience, under which circumstances do student flourish most?
 
AF: From my experience, students work best when the educator can let go of control. They need to be left alone sometimes and need to be given the opportunity to rest. Students need to feel confident with their processes and free to do things without supervision.   

We are all in a process of learning, but design projects should be designed as a process. Pushing students too hard might not have a positive effect on their education. Education is a process that students and educators experience together, so it should also be a good time. There are different forms of pressure: negative pressure is very counterproductive, which I too have experienced as a student. I think that this kind of pressure is particularly prominent at art academies. 

On the other hand, positive pressure can come from within and relates to what students want to achieve, the goal they want to reach together with others. That can be to have an exhibition, or to develop a prototype that works, or to experiment. It can be ok to be competitive, but we need to consider how to approach this as an attitude. 

While I consider design as powerful, I find it helpful to adopt an approach that is informed by Bruno Latour and Donna Haraway, who both emphasise the importance of the network and the actors within it. If you're collectively working towards a concrete goal situated in the real world, like an exhibition, it's easier to learn and practice certain technical or organisational skills and people motivate each other.

JP: What do you mean when you use of the word 'hybrid' in the context of design education?  
 
AF: I started using the word 'hybrid' before the pandemic in the context of research about digital spaces and realised that it can be quite productive to consider designing these spaces at this moment in time. During the pandemic, some students had to go back to their homes abroad and were suddenly able to attend classes when before that wasn't considered possible. 

The question of how to connect to other people drives my research. Although I think that it's great to explore digital spaces, we shouldn't forget that direct social interaction is still very valuable and that the digital can't replace the physical. Both realms allow for social interaction but they are of a different character. 
 
JP: Is the Non-School situated mostly outside of the classroom?
 
AF: Finding out where the Non-School is situated is the essence of the professorship. I approach this question by experimenting with different conditions of what a school can be and entering into an exchange with students and tutors about their experiences, There are certain encounters you can't have via a video call. It's much more direct to share a physical space. 

I'm eager to explore the creation of spaces that encourage meaningful encounters. We have a variety of media with different materialities which we use to talk and communicate, and I want to understand how these can be connected to digitality. This is a technological question but it also relates to sociology. I’ve been focused on exploring the technological side of my research, but I'm also eager to look into the social aspect, which is more about engaging with the teaching at the Academy as an educator with a collaborative approach. There's also a very pragmatic side to the Non-School, so it's not only about experimenting but also about developing educational approaches. 
 
JP: What relevance does the practice of Open Design have for your research? 
 
AF: A recent project of mine was about improvisation and I discovered that the capacity to improvise is linked to being able to connect various subsystems. For example, when you're participating in a workshop and you want to produce a prototype, you need to be able to put different parts together and to work with what emerges spontaneously. I consider these spontaneous creations as hybrid systems, which contain a certain quality of hybridity, which is a concept that I'm generally interested in. This is another reason why I find Design Academy Eindhoven an interesting place for research, because the curriculum of each course includes a certain hybridity, which can be about bringing theoretical thought and making together, or combining elements from a variety of disciplines. Hybridity is part of the essence of Design Academy Eindhoven, and I see a particular quality in the things being developed and made here.

In November 2020, the Research Department of Design Academy Eindhoven launched [three professorships, which form the core of a new research programme pivoting around the notion of Becoming](https://designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/news/a-new-era-for-design-research-at-design-academy-eindhoven). This programme is articulated through three interconnected strands: Diversity & Inclusion, Transdisciplinary Design Networks, and The Non-School. The professorships will be spearheaded by Dr Praveen Sewgobind, Dr Ian Biscoe and Dr Annika Frye.

The Becoming programme responds to a need for us to re-examine how both human and non-human actors can have a perpetual and meaningful agency in effecting change. The sensation of continuous transformation, exciting and terrifying at the same time, calls on us to rethink every aspect of our existence, from the simplest to the most complex. Becoming requires inventiveness, coordination and empathic abilities. The scale of the challenges that lie ahead require concerted efforts from across the disciplinary spectrum and the switch that needs to be made is often radical.
