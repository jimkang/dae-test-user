# THE NON-SCHOOL

## An alternative future for design education

What if design education was open, accessible and participatory? Overturning traditional concepts of the ‘design school’, Dr Annika Frye will experiment with new practices of network, communication and digital learning spaces to challenge the idea of the school as an enclosed, spatial entity.

Dr Frye is an expert in Open Design – which, in the context of design processes, breaks up hierarchies by creating a network of actors – and has recently been exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education. In the next stage of her research, she will investigate how to apply the strategies of Open Design to digital learning in design. Her professorship responds to and anticipates the next stage of an extraordinarily fertile culture of fully or partly remote learning opportunities and online or blended education programmes that has emerged in the last decade. It aims to recognise learning as becoming, using technology as an instrument of evolution and democratisation of learning in design.

Dr Frye is a designer and researcher. Her practices include writing, teaching and projects in the field of experimental industrial design. Also a professor of Design Studies at Muthesius Academy of the Arts in Kiel, Germany, she is currently researching changes in design processes regarding the qualities of digital materiality in the intersection of design, art and technology.
