# TRANSDISCIPLINARY DESIGN NETWORKS

DAE is one of the worldâ€™s leading design schools, recognised internationally for its forward-thinking and renowned professors and alumni. For over 70 years it has trained aspiring designers to make their mark on the future by thinking freely and openly about what design can achieve, consistently exploring design as an instrument of material, social, environmental and critical innovation.

Transdisciplinary Design Networks (TDN) comprise of technological and societal domains, they support the investigation of how macroscopic approaches can be leveraged to address global system-of-system challenges. TDNs are enabled through  new tools and methodologies, ones with which creatives can work collaboratively to better comprehend and address the challenges that are the result of global systems dynamics: networked workspaces that enable collaboration regardless of location, that support rich interactive visualisation across realities. The creation of such environments supports the transdisciplinary investigation and development of designed solutions to planetary challenges. These networked environments provide a greater understanding of the interaction of such complex systems through the communication of those complexities beyond domain experts. It builds on existing original research in the use of X-Reality networked environments in arts practice and education. to investigate issues around planetary analysis, comprehension, design and communication.
