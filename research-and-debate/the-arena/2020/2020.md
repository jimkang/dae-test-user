# THE ARENA 2020

With the excellence of Graduates’ work and design research at its heart, The Arena is Design Academy Eindhoven’s (DAE) in-house platform for debate and discussion. As a part of DAE’s annual Graduation Show, The Arena programme is designed to explore and contextualise aspects of the Graduates’ design practice that inform and surpass a final object or outcome. 
 
This year, during DDW, The Arena has an online programme broadcasted live on DDW TV and DAE’s Instagram. Graduates will also be hosting the (G)Radio show on RaRaRadio on Sunday 18th from 11:00 ([rararadio.org](https://www.rararadio.org), @gradio.gs20). 
 
Tune in to [DDW TV](https://ddw.nl) daily from 14:30-15:30 for panel discussions on the dilemmas of institutional critique, bio-politics and collective care, power structures behind invisible infrastructures, interrogations on cultural heritage and more. 
 
Also join us on the [@designacademy](https://www.instagram/com/designacademy) at 12:00 and 18:00 for interactive graduate talks, workshops and performances. Each session will elaborate on graduate design processes, methodologies and final outcomes.

**Architectures for the Self**
As we live in increasingly confined and restricted situations, how can we carve out new architectures of time and space for ourselves? For action, self-expression and self-care, of ourselves and others. By bringing in perspectives from the physical to the virtual, the immaterial to the material and from the individual to the collective, this panel will discuss the relevance and need for architectures for the self.

**Methods of New Materialism**
How do materials around us construct and inform our lives? How should we consider our relationships with them, in terms of use and value? By examining narratives of material production, life cycles and infrastructure, this panel will revisit the position of designers in the field of 'new materialism'.

**(Un)seen: Invisible Infrastructures**
Infrastructures enable certain types of mobility and transactions to take place. Our primary way of interacting with these infrastructures, however, is through an interface, whether it be a screen, object, or system. What happens when we look beyond their interfaces? What do we learn about the politics and power structures of the systems surrounding us?

**Illuminating the Black Box**
In a world where tech-giants fuel rapid, eternal growth, the average citizen struggles to negotiate their autonomy. Veiled by glossy promises of bigger, better and faster, surveillance and governance are hard to navigate. Through radical connections and methods of subversion, can design empower us to create new understandings about technology?

**Ctrl + C**
Considering approaches to co-authorship, this panel seeks to revisit repetition and copy culture within the field of design. Taking the lead from three of this year's graduates, we will look to address the perception of the copy at large and question whether it is time to shift the attitude of design towards copy and paste.

**Beyond a Better History**
Design, and the designer, have often been synonymous with notions of innovation, and producing something ‘better’. What if we are faced with contexts and situations where this is not the end point, or even a desirable goal? This panel examines practices of journalistic design and will discuss the roles and responsibilities of designers in a ‘post-better’ world.

**Contagious Care**
Science has shaped a conception of cleanliness that feeds misconceptions about the importance of our microbiome. In an era of microbial fear, brought on by the current Covid-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to understand how micro-organisms impact practices of health. This panel will invite conversations around how we can understand microbial bodies, and explore embodied and more-than-human systems of health.

**DAE, then comes the moment to act**
As creative antagonists, we are often left with the task of putting out the fires of modernity, unable to contend with the larger structural and systemic issues which continually reignite those very same flames. How then do ‘we’ build moments, spaces and movements that ultimately result in lasting, generative change to such structures?

**Abandoning Nature?**
Our relationship with nature and its resources has withered. Shaped by a self-centered social order, the language of legislature, consumer products and media have led us down a path towards indifference and panic. Through techniques of unveiling hidden values and storytelling, how can design help us gain vital knowledge of the complexities of nature, and rekindle a long lost bond?
