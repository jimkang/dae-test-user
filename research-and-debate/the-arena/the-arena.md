# THE ARENA

## The Arena is a live talks, debate and performance platform that takes place at the centre of the annual DAE Graduation Show.

---

The Arena was born in 2016 out of an urge to challenge contemporary design discourse.

At that time, it had become evident that many of the graduates taking part in the Graduation Show were no longer focussed on creating static objects. Investigative methods relating to research, journalism and institutional critique were increasingly visible in projects. Performance was not only being used to communicate the final ideas of some designers, but had also become a key strategic tool to drive ongoing design processes. And it was becoming a strong feature within the Graduation Show.

The Arena, therefore, was started in order to offer a space for emerging designers to not only present their work, but to also engage in conversations about the ins and outs of design. This primarily took place through presentations and performance as well as debates and roundtable conversations.

These discussions and presentations were well attended by visitors to the Graduation Show as well DAE students. Participants on the stage were challenged with critical and insightful questions from the audience as well as the moderators.

When Joseph Grima became Creative Director of DAE in 2017, the Arena was developed further, with a clear strategic position in the curation of the 2018 Graduation Show.

Design Academy Eindhoven’s Graduation Show is much more than an exhibition of objects and installations. In 2019, in addition to the 61 Masters’ and 120 Bachelors’ projects exhibited in the former Campina milk factory, there were nine full days of programming at The Arena.

Currently, The Arena hosts performances, film screenings, presentations and panel discussions staged by graduates, alongside prominent professionals from the field and the extended DAE community. Each year visitors have experienced debates around a variety of topics such as artificial intelligence, design aesthetics, social identities and public space, with curious and critical panels. The Arena also features graduate performances, hosting everything from visions for future cities to conspiracy theories.

As DAE has shifted focus and changed its understanding of design, it has placed a strong importance on the framing of the discourse around design. Stemming from the excellence of our graduates’ work, The Arena is our permanent in-house platform for debate and discussion. It addresses aspects of design practice that underpin and transcend an object or outcome, further contextualising the work that is on display in today’s world.
