## Alumni 

Design Academy Eindhoven has strong connections with its alumni. They are an important source of what is going on in the world of design.  

Via social media, work field and feedback sessions, interviews and surveys, our alumni share their professional insights and reflect on how their education helped them in their professional career.  

Every year DAE scouts for new teaching talents amongst its alumni. From the current Ba and MA heads 50% is an alumnus from DAE and in each BA studio or MA lab you will find former students teaching current students. It may not come as a surprise that some alumni are in return a source of inspiration to our current students.  

DAE also sees the commitment of our alumni back in setting up educational collaboration projects or offering internships to our students. They come back to the school to get inspiration and offering realistic business cases to current students.  

DAE is very thankful for the support of alumni in its variety. During the school year alumni are invited to join our lectures and participate in thematic exhibitions and juries. Highlight of the year is DAEâ€™s annual Alumni Homecoming Breakfast during the Graduation Show. Before opening hours, alumni will have time to reconnect with classmates and see the work of the next generation alumni.
