# BACHELORS’S PROGRAMMES

## Who are you? Who do you want to be? 
## What kind of world do you want to live in?

---

A Bachelor's degree at Design Academy Eindhoven is a four-year programme that offers students the opportunity to develop their own answers to these fundamental questions.

We live in a designed world, surrounded by objects, systems and processes that have been created by humans. Designers have the power to affect change through their work, influencing everyday life and shaping behaviours from the micro to the macro level. 

Bachelor students at DAE are provided with space, support and guidance to explore their relationship with design, as well as its potential as a tool for positive action in a world that is in constant flux. DAE nurtures independent thinking and encourages students to engage deeply with themselves and with their environment, to be curious and to question their assumptions, and to interrogate systems of power, of knowledge and of production.

## PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE

Learning through making is a central concept at DAE. There is a strong focus on 'doing', whether it is experimenting with manufacturing, developing a stream of research or collaborating with fellow students to test solutions and explore problems. The schools' workshops play a key part in the BA programme, with [eight spaces](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/workshops) dedicated to different materials. For more technical work, the school has fostered partnerships with specialist centres for production, including the Textile Museum in Tilburg, Atelier.nl, the EKWC (the European ceramic Work Centre) in Den Bosch and Bruns (a model-making company) in Bergeijk. 

Tutors at DAE are practising professionals and only teach at the school one day per week. With more than 150 designers, theorists, curators, writers, artists and researchers among the faculty, students are exposed to actual working practices throughout their studies and are often invited to work on real-world projects, either within their programme or through the school's collaborations with organisations outside of the Academy.

## STUDIOS

A supportive, safe learning environment is key to both personal and professional development. But flexibility, realism and agility are also increasingly important within all forms of education. The realities of the world around us – from pandemics to the climate crisis – demand new approaches. 

In 2020, the school overhauled its educational structure, reshaping the BA department to better respond to the needs of its students and the increasing pace of change in the wider world. This included the introduction of a new structure, with eight studios, each reflecting a different perspective and position but united in a belief in design as an agent for positive change and a desire to contribute to creating a better future. Students can switch between different studios during their studies, providing new opportunities for exploration, experimentation and research as their interests change.
