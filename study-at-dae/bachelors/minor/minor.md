# MINOR

## Alongside [the Studio system](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/bachelors/studios), the BA curriculum includes a full-time Minors programme in the third year of the degree. This takes place during the first half of the first semester.

---

Minors are specialised design courses, developed as part of the BA programme to deepen the expertise of each student, as well as provide opportunities to explore a variety of approaches to and positions on design.

During a minor, each student focusses on a specific theme, subject, material or method provided by the course leader, while simultaneously exploring their design journey.

Minors include different types of learning and teaching – lectures, workshops, discussions, feedback and hands-on learning – both in groups or individually.

All of the current Minors take students through a complete design process. All participants must present their work and take part in the curation of an exhibition as part of the programme.

In fall 2020, the Academy will offer the following Minors:

• Ceramic Properties & Potentials
• Collective Minor
• Exchange
• Lost & Found
• Making Futures
• Metal Crafts
• Reframing Textiles

The range of topics and issues covered by the different courses relate directly to current, real-world developments and challenges. The Collective Minor allows students to design their own education.

Students can also opt to choose an exchange programme with a partner institution for their Minor.

All Minors are full time, with approximately three days of classes and two days of self-study and assigned work. A completed Minor accounts for 30 ECTS.

Minor classes take place within Design Academy Eindhoven and one other location, which varies depending on the course. Minors also collaborate closely with specialised workshops within and around Eindhoven to give students access to relevant expertise, materials and tools.
