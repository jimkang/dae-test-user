# THE PROPAEDEUTIC YEAR

## The Propaedeutic Year is the introductory year for all students studying on the BA programme at Design Academy Eindhoven.

---

This first year of study is a year of exploration. Students are introduced to the various approaches and media that can be part of design: drawing, imaging, prototyping, reflecting, experimenting, analysing, communicating and performing. They are exposed to a wide range of perspectives on design and approaches to making. It is an intensive experience that allows students to explore the breadth of the design profession.

Many students discover that design is a much wider field than they imagined. The introductory year takes them beyond product design, introducing design as a tool for shaping and creating activities, services, spaces, events, stories, emotions, ideas, systems, processes and combinations of these.

The aim is for each individual to find the approach and position that is best suited to their interests, skills and outlook. Students work with international peers and discover unexpected qualities in themselves and others. They learn to embrace failure and expand their area of play.

DAE adheres to the principle of ‘thinking through making’. The Propadeutic Year promotes a hands-on attitude to design and helps students understand what ‘thinking through making’ actually means in practice. They learn to reflect on the use and meaning of design and acquaint themselves with the history of the profession and the basics of design research.

At the end of the Propadeutic Year, students will have gained a solid theoretical foundation and several basic skills that will provide a strong foundation for their further studies at the Academy and their design practice.
