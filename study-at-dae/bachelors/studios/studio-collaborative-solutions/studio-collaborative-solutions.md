# Studio Collaborative Solutions

## Where public and private meet, merge and crossover, 
## an exciting field emerges for designers.

---

Led by designer Stijn Roodnat, Studio Collaborative Solutions is one of the studios that make up the BA programme at Design Academy Eindhoven. Each studio represents a different view of design.

Even before Covid-19, public and private domains were blurring and new, undivided domains emerging. In recent months this has been accelerated: the office has entered our homes, public parks are increasingly used to meet friends and play sports, while restaurants and bars are quickly reshaping to stay relevant. Along with this change comes a new set of decisions for each individual about where to go, what to do, and – most importantly – what to share and what to keep to themselves.

This shifting and blurring of boundaries demand new ideas to help the human feel at home, enable them to display their identity, to be comfortable and safe – to live. It requires new ideas about public space, redefining its functions and position in the community. This opens up new possibilities for designers, architects and other creative minds that can shape our living space and – at the same time – challenge the way we work.

Studio Collaborative Solutions focusses on one key element of this exciting new age: sharing. Sharing spaces, products, and functions – no longer owning or claiming what is yours. But also sharing building blocks, such as raw materials, semi-finished goods, buildings, public areas. Exploring the reuse, recycling, re-functioning of products and spaces to address the increasing scarcity of important resources. Sharing know-how, talent, insights and effort.

The studio will continuously interrogate the evolving role of the designer, resolving increasingly complex issues. Today's challenges require a new type of designer. Today's designer cannot be 'just' an artist but must be part of the team, using their unique skills and talent to become the translator of ideas into tangible results, as well as being an initiator, connector, and visionary leading the public debate on how to shape our shared domains.

The studio aims to develop students who can fulfil a key role within the multidisciplinary teams that will be essential to find solutions to the major challenges facing society. Each designer will develop an understanding of their strengths and weaknesses, as well as their particular talent. They will learn to act as a generalist, using the know-how of a specialist, to share their ideas and present new perspectives in a way that is tangible and accessible to collaborators. And they will learn the skills to turn ideas into aesthetic, practical, usable designs, that can be materialised and communicated.

Collaboration is an essential part of the studio's programme. For the academic year 2020-2021, the studio will partner with specialists and businesses from outside the Academy to cover topics including circularity in design with the Dutch construction company Volker Wessels; recycling and re-use with Peter Rem, head of Resources & Recycling at TU Delft; collaborating in multidisciplinary teams with Clemens

Driessen and Lenora Ditzler, researchers at Wageningen University who are involved in the Pixel Farming project; and coping with talent with a ballet dancer from the Netherlands Danstheater.
