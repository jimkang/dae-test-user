What is design? No matter what it is, it is in constant change. What matters is what we
want to do with it. In Studio Do-Make we learn design by doing design, and we learn design by making design.

Design could be a tool to analyse our time, a tool to help us adapt and understand our
(sociological and physical) environment, which is in a constant mutating process, in perpetual evolution. Design can help us prepare our society, our context, for these
changes.

Design creates experiences, how we relate to our surrounding. The concept of human
being in relation to our environment. Experiences are the core element of our
memories and our memories form who we are. What are the experiences then that we
want to create for us and for others? What are those experiences that will shape us for
the future?

In this rapidly changing world, we must come up with fast solutions and
improvise ideas that can be the core of something bigger, leading us to structural solutions—guiding us towards not just a temporary fashion or style but to real fundamental changes.

The examination of ourselves is considered a fundamental process in developing the most unique tool in our design process—our personal way of thinking, formed by all our
previous experiences, which guides our vision and approach to doing. This is our personal creative DNA, our unique selling point, and will allow us to understand how to generate our own methodology for exploring infinite solutions for infinite different
situations. This will allow us to work in the complex network of today, solving complex problems by applying simple, but not always obvious, solutions.

Questions that we wish to investigate in the coming years:
→ How can we connect with others to share ideas?
→ How do we build communication channels/objects that lead us to dialogue, action and experiences?
→ How to create symbiotic relations and hybridize with different disciplines?
