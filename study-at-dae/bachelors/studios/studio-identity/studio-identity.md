# STUDIO IDENTITY

## Through our appearance, we send visual cues about our personal characteristics: gender, social orientation, ethnic background, age, status and social, cultural and political viewpoints.

---

Led by designer Marty Lamers, Studio Identity is one of eight studios that currently make up the BA department at Design Academy Eindhoven. Each studio represents a particular view of design. Students are invited to select one studio to begin their studies, but may change during the year to reflect shifts in their own interests. 

Studio Identity focusses on the idea of the body as a vehicle for social exploration and communication and a site for and of design.

Through our appearance, we can distinguish ourselves from ‘the other’, while simultaneously striving for a sense of social bonding and belonging. 

Our body can be a canvas. We can dress, decorate and display it, yet we can also camouflage or disguise it. Our body can also be a pamphlet – we can use it to express our perspectives, attitudes and beliefs or to protest and subvert.

Drawing upon our intuition, sensibilities and imagination, we can invent and reinvent our self- and group identity, both in the physical worlds and virtual realms. 

Studio Identity deals with the fundamental questions:

*Who am I and who do I want to be?
Who are you and who do you want to be?
Who are we and who do we want to be?*

The studio encourages interaction and synergy between students, collaborators and educators. Members of the studio will learn to develop and trust their intuition as a key skill within design. 

Students who join the studio must be able to adapt quickly and enjoy working at a fast pace. They should be able to make swift changes and react to rapid changes within society. They should be versatile, curious and capable of handling a myriad of projects and ideas at the same time.
