# Studio Living Matter

## Studio Living Matter is one of eight studios within the Bachelor programme at Design Academy Eindhoven, each representing a different view of design.

---

Led by Marije Vogelzang, Studio Living Matter invites students to begin their creative and design process with living matter. Living matter is represented by food, but also by plants and animals in general, atoms, time, energy, synergy, rituals and human beings. Dealing with living matter demands a specific position from a designer. Time becomes an important factor. So does the definition of ‘end product’. How can we deal with living matter while researching new technologies like gen tech or synthetic biology but also just letting a seed sprout?

The world’s most pressing issues are related to food and consumption. Think of the loss of biodiversity, pollinator decline, obesity, starvation, empty oceans, food safety, climate change, antibiotic resistance, freshwater supply, seed sovereignty and even migration streams are connected to (lack of) food. Studio Living Matter does not claim that designers can solve these issues, but it does believe that designers can help bring unconventional ideas and unexpected connections into a broken system.

Globally, food is the biggest economic driver. But food – in all its simplicity – is also a connector between people. Food can be a medicine, food rituals can bring meaning and security into social life. Food is connected to identity, to history and culture. Food is what we need to live, in the most basic sense. It is the essence of life.

Most of us live an urbanised life, largely surrounded by static objects that are frozen in time and not subject to the seasons, to transformation, to decay or growth. We build lasting objects to live in and with. Static time has become an ideal. Digitalisation has even allowed us to shed our corporeal bodies and enter a virtual state, where sensorial experiences are limited and controlled.

We have banished most living creatures from our lives and only keep pets and plants as a cultivated decorum to remind us of our ability to conquer nature. The food we eat is idealised and brought to us in a perfect state. We have become so accustomed to industrialised food that most of our preferences are based on this. We take food for granted as ever-present, fresh and affordable. This creates a disconnect. We have created a society that ignores the cyclic state of birth and death, of eating and being eaten and the magical, incomprehensible mystery of life itself. But humans were once surrounded by organic materials that were alive, dealing with decay, growth and change as constants in our lives.

Students joining Studio Living Matter should have a strong interest in all things biological and organic. They should be curious to explore new ways of thinking about objects and the role of design in an industrialised society.
