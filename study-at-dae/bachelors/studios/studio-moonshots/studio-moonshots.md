# Studio Moonshots

## ‘A moonshot, in a technology context, is an ambitious, exploratory and groundbreaking project undertaken without any expectation of near-term profitability or benefit and also, perhaps, without a full investigation of potential risks and benefits.’ 
– Margaret Rouse, Whatis.techtarget.com

Led by designer and educator Catelijne van Middlekoop, Studio Moonshots is one of eight studios in the BA programme at Design Academy Eindhoven. Each studio represents a different perspective on design.

Studio Moonshots is a fluid environment that fosters critical thinking alongside design processes and creative output within the context of communication, visual culture, media and technology. The studio’s students often possess broad interests and a general fascination with visual, cultural and digital media or specific craft-based phenomena.

The studio will initially focus on imparting a true sense of scale, obtaining a greater and more critical understanding of the diverse range of media that can be used to communicate various forms of information and the importance of defining the most desirable context and ways in which this information is delivered to/ shared with a carefully specified audience.

Students will acquire the skills and knowledge to conduct and organise research, understand how this fits into the design process and how thorough analysis helps to develop a strong and communicative concept. A strong emphasis is placed on the

translation and presentation of the main conclusions or outcome(s) of the research, but the format and media for this are open, although they much suit the content and the presentation must be directed towards at least one other ‘being’ (another person, an animal, a robot…).

Tools such as graphic design, film and (visual/written/ programming) language are used to conceptualize ideas and make them presentable and understandable to others. Students are encouraged to extend their work field/scope beyond the digital and into the physical domain. Curiosity in and a solid understanding of both digital and technological developments at large is required.

Students will acquire a basic understanding of programming languages such as python and p5 (and their relation to AI and machine learning), and will gain practical experience through experiments with web interfaces and generative design processes.

In a continuously changing world which is becoming more and more complex and in which the role of the designer as well as design are constantly questioned, critical thinking and self-reflection are two essential competencies. These will be addressed in all aspects of the studio's activities.

Students will be constantly asked both 'Why?' And 'What if?' The latter addresses the important and speculative aspects of design that play a key role within the course. Students are asked to depict and visualise desirable situations in which their

concepts should ideally be presented and create convincing prototypes/provotypes and artefacts to support these scenarios.

The Moonshots programme includes real-life experiences with external knowledge partners. Among these is a collaboration with high-tech company ASML, born out of the Covid-19 crisis. This project, called ‘Business as Unusual. Engineering Design for a (Post Pandemic Reality)' will form a red thread throughout Studio Moonshots.
