# STUDIO TURN AROUND!

## Our consumption patterns have created a system of mass waste production. Studio Turn Around! sees this as the main challenge for designers today. We must find ways to move towards a circular society, but how can we create attractive, sustainable solutions for everyday life?

---

Led by designer Jelle Zijlstra, Studio Turn Around! is one of eight studios that currently make up the BA department at Design Academy Eindhoven. 

There are new solutions to be discovered: a circular society can be achieved by utilising new technologies like connectivity, robotics, 3D-printing and the fluidity between hardware and software. These developments allow us to rethink and rebuild the lost connections between human needs, technology and planet Earth. 

Our drive is to improve the world of industrial creation by enabling students to design new values for products, services and brands. We ask the questions: What really moves people? How can we create a circular system? What is our contribution as designers? 

'Turn Around!' refers to the need to work towards a systemic change in our industrialised society. The Coronavirus crisis will not automatically lead to this change – conscious steps must be made to take us in a different direction. 

'Turn Around!' is also a reference to circularity and the drive to investiagte what this really means for industry, for design and for society. The machinery of industrial production can’t function without the circular movement of turbines, axles, cogs and wheels. Currently, the outcome tends to be linear: a system of take - make - waste, with profit and wealth as ultimate goals. Moving away from this to think in circles seems to require a shift of mindset, an awareness of long-term outcomes and how parts of the global system are interconnected.  

Studio Turn Around! will ask students to consider their position as a designer in relation to these ideas. How can the individual help create and strengthen the awareness needed for circularity? What will inspire people to aim for value and well-being instead of profit and wealth? 

How can we make things – and people – turn around?
