# STUDIO URGENCIES

## Studio Urgencies views design as a positive profession contributing to questions and challenges in different contexts and on different scales. Times change, urgencies change, questions change.

Led by artist Irene Droogleever Fortuyn, Studio Urgencies is one of eight studios that currently make up the BA department at Design Academy Eindhoven. 

During the industrial boom of the 20th-century's post-war period, demand for product design was high. The *De Academie voor Industriële Vormgeving* was founded in Eindhoven, answering the need to create designers for industry. Hardcore product design and artistic experimentation found their home here from the start. By the end of the 20th century, the academy had become Design Academy Eindhoven. Dutch Design became a term used to describe a movement characterised by products with a twist; playful, human, sensual and with a distinct signature – with Design Academy Eindhoven at its heart. Then came the 21st century, with its ever-clearer global challenges. Social and environmental sustainability started to shape education. 

With the current scientific understanding that energy is the fundamental particle, not matter, it makes perfect sense to include the flow and exchange of energy in the process and outcome of a design practice. Combined with the knowledge that the researcher is part of the research and the awareness that all is part of an interconnected ecosystem, this creates a fantastic playground for designers of the future to contribute to the challenges of this era.  

Studio Urgencies offers a challenging and adventurous programme with questioning, imagining, making, mapping, exchanging, researching, exhibiting, interacting and designing at its core. It aims to help students discover and develop their responsiveness to and interaction with the world around them, within a safe learning environment that supports personal and professional development.  

The Studio collaborates with external partners, including organisations, festivals, cities, communities and companies. The outcome will always be visualised or materialised in some form. One example from the third year of the programme is [the City Circles research tool](www.citycircles.nl).  

The key skills of a Studio Urgencies student include endurance and persistence, curiosity and openness, a strong sense of ethics and aesthetics and a keen environmental and social awareness. The ability to observe, listen, question and reflect before formulating an opinion is crucial. 

Students will be encouraged to define the meaning of "quality", collaborate with fellow students as well as individuals and organisations from outside the Academy and learn how to curate their projects for display and engagement.
