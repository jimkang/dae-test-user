# BACHELOR STUDIOS AT DESIGN ACADEMY EINDHOVEN

In 2020, Design Academy Eindhoven began a reorganisation of the Bachelors' department as part of a wider project to overhaul the school’s approach to education. The previous course structure has been replaced by a series of studios, each standing for a specific view on design and built around the vision of a studio leader.

Our ultimate aim is to develop programmes, departments and organisations that are more responsive to today’s world and the individual needs of our students. One of our goals is to make the student central in everything we do. This means offering a tailor-made design education, which makes the transition from departments to studios essential.

For now, there are eight studios, although this can change to reflect the interests and needs of the student body. The studios are:

▪ [The Morning Studio](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/bachelors/the-morning-studio), led by Thomas Lommée
▪ [Studio Collaborative Solutions](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/bachelors/studio-collaborative-solutions), led by Stijn Roodnat
▪ [Studio Moonshots](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/bachelors/studio-moonshots), led by Catelijne van Middelkoop
▪ [Studio Turn Around!](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/bachelors/studio-turn-around!), led by Jelle Zijlstra
▪ [Studio Living Matter](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/bachelors/studio-living-matter), led by Marije Vogelzang
▪ [Studio Identity](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/bachelors/studio-identity), led by Marty Lammers
▪ [Studio Urgencies](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/bachelors/studio-urgencies), led by Irene Fortuyn
▪ [The Invisible Studio](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/bachelors/the-invisible-studio), led by Mario Minale


Every new student is invited to choose one studio to begin their studies and can select a different studio per semester or stay with the same studio throughout the year. This means that an individual’s selection can change over time as they develop different interests.

This system will be evaluated in consultation with our students during the academic year and adjusted where necessary.
