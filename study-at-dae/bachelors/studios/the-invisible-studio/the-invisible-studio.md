# THE INVISIBLE STUDIO

## ‘The individual mind is immanent but not only in the body. It is immanent also in messages and passages outside the body. And there is a larger Mind of which the individual mind is only a sub-system. This larger mind is comparable to God and is perhaps what some people mean by God, but it is still immanent in the total interconnected social system and planetary ecology.’

 

--Gregory Bateson, Form, Substance, and Difference

Led by designer Mario Minale, The Invisible Studio is one of eight studios that currently make up the BA department at Design Academy Eindhoven. Each studio represents a particular view of design. 

In The Invisible Studio, we work with the invisible processes behind the material world, from manufacturing, prototyping, tools, resources, economics, and policymaking to material science, engineering, particle physics, living, self-maintaining systems and self-designing potentialities. 

We also work with the invisible processes behind creativity and innovation, using body consciousness and practicing mindfulness. Through the observation of visible patterns we study symbols, images, myths, archetypes and eschatologies. 

Our inspirations are systems and ecological design, lo-fi theory and permaculture principles. We prototype and develop production tools. We are open to feedback in every phase of the process. We constantly exercise improvisational skills to help reframe mindsets. Transdisciplinarity and biodiversity are our sources as well as our aims. 

Design practice has reoriented. Traditionally, design was linked to objects and to technological change, to the individual, to the market and to being carried out by experts. But over the last decade it has turned towards a user-centred approach – situated, interactive, collaborative, participatory, focused on the production of human experience and life itself.  

Particles are a useful metaphor to help us understand how this shift affects our understanding of ourselves as designers. Invisible to the human eye, particles constitute the continuum of our reality: light, the realms of the subatomic, atoms and molecules, proteins, crystals, sand. Deeply interconnected, they mutually interfere, manifesting a quality in space, forming complex systems and displaying swarm behaviour. 

As designers, we are also agents of these energies – part of these invisible patterns at work, influenced by and influencing each other and the world around us. Developing an awareness of this and using it to realise our own visions, prevents us from being trapped by our ego and allows us to create in union with the anima mundi. By listening to and observing our surroundings, we place ourselves in the service of collectivity.
