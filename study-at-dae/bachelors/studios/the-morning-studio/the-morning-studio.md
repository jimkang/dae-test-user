# THE MORNING STUDIO

## The Morning Studio positions design as a tool for connection and healing through protest, engagement and change.

---

Led by designer Thomas Lommée, The Morning Studio is one of eight studios that currently make up the BA department at Design Academy Eindhoven. Each studio represents a different view of design, shaped by the individual specialisms and interests of its head. 

Being in sync with what surrounds us, being embedded within a community, being at ease with ourselves – these conditions have been eroded by a dogma that celebrates the individual, stimulates overall competition and commodifies just about everything it can lay its hands upon. 

Within The Morning Studio, students will focus on concepts and ideas that counter this fragmentation by focusing on projects that have the potential to reconnect and mend. Together, we will create projects that are at times humble and other times bold, but always straightforward, directed towards everyday life and focussed on long-term implementation. 

In doing so, The Morning Studio aims to use design as a tool for constructive protest and collective action, opposing by proposing, calm but engaged, patient but stubborn, as a group if we can, fully autonomous if we must. At times with humour and irony, but always with great attention and care. 
 
Throughout this process, participants in The Morning Studio will seek the collective, the overlap, the pattern. The things we have in common in order to build a larger story over time, as a department, as a school, as a society. A shared narrative of interdependent projects and collaborative practices, a story that prioritises the interconnections over the individual nodes, thereby underlining the belief that new opportunities are to be found in the in-between and that big change doesn’t necessarily need a big masterplan. 

Students taking part in The Morning Studio should be driven by a desire for change, a strong interest in collectivity and collaboration, and a strong interest in the mundanities and extraordinary occurrences in everyday life.
