## Well Being

‘Cool head, warm heart’. Things, environments, and experiences that are designed to enhance life and enable us to thrive. Whether you are looking at for example, cutlery, water, dance or design for the health care system, wellbeing is the starting point for your design approach. You design with a view to integrating the way things look with human experience; you look at projects from a physical and emotional perspective, practical and poetic, individual and social.’One eye sees, the other feels’.
