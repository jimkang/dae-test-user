# FOUNDATION YEAR

## For the third time, Design Academy Eindhoven is starting a Foundation Year in September 2022 for anyone* who is interested in a career in the creative industries, but who feel they lack the skills and materials to put together an effective portfolio or if you're not sure if a design education is right for you.

The Foundation Year takes place at our academy in Eindhoven.

*: Dutch and English-speaking candidates who live in the Netherlands or nearby.

Are you attempting to identify your talents and want confirmation that you have chosen the correct course of study? Or do you just want to invest in developing your creativity?

---

Starting on September 17, 2022, the Foundation Year takes place over 30 Saturdays in the Academy building in Eindhoven. Participants will have first-hand experience of DAE’s working methods, its workshops and teaching staff. The course has a hands-on approach, providing students with a knowledge of different research methods, which they then translate into creative solutions independently and in project teams. This allows participants to develop a portfolio that can be the basis for their application for a degree course at DAE. The Foundation Year incorporates an assessment procedure. Completion of the course does not guarantee admission but certainly increase participants’ chances. Application is open to all. There are no admission requirements.

→*What does the course cover?*

You will have hands-on access to all the workshops and will learn to make something and build confidence in your creative abilities.

Your own vision, interests and senses are paramount. You will experiment and conduct research and develop your sense of design. You will learn new techniques and discover how to invest ‘making’ with meaning and how to analyse and give concrete form to design assignments. At the end of the course, you will be able to create a solid portfolio that showcases your qualities and insights, and you will have a better idea of your possible future options in the design field. The course demands considerable effort and initiative from all participants. All lecturers are professional designers with their own practice. At the end of the course, your development will be evaluated and you will receive advice about your future options.

---

## The course covers the following topics:

- form studies,
- colour studies,
- materials research,
- techniques and media,
- experimentation and prototyping (making things yourself),
- (visual) research (film and photography)
- documenting your work,
- introduction to professional terminology
- portfolio as an archiving process
- social orientation
- visits to studios of professional designers
- museum visits
- and many other skills.

---

## Completion of the course gives you:

- a certificate of participation
- an admission assessment for the bachelor degree course at DAE
- excellent preparation for the bachelor degree course at DAE

If you are unsure whether the Foundation Year is right for you, you can request an interview to discuss your options or mail to Foundationyear@designacademy.nl
