# GRADUATION SHOW 2021 (16 - 24 Oct)
An index is a guide or symbol used to navigate everything from books and Html to stock markets and colour swatches. It is also the finger used to point, notably at touchscreens. This year, the Design Academy Eindhoven Graduation Show 2021 presents a navigational index as an invitation to explore the themes, keywords, materials and methodologies of the 163 graduation projects. 

Rather than an overarching narrative, the index is a tool to explore how different readings and realities emerge by design. In an index, there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the sign and the signified; each word is symbolic of a connection to a larger context. In the same way, the projects themselves may each be read as a symbolic index of the design field, current times, and possible futures. The projects acknowledge that reality is not a universal given or a consolidated narrative but a contested territory; one that is open to rereading, alteration and reinterpretation.

# THE STAGE
As graduates investigate the role of design in shaping reality through an increasingly diverse range of practices, we need new ways of presenting these expanded definitions of design to the world. 

The Stage is the Graduation Show's new platform, offering a digitally-mediated environment alongside the physical exhibition of projects and the Arena's programme of live talks and debates challenging and extending contemporary design discourse. 

Twenty-five of the 163 graduates are presenting on The Stage. It also forms the site for the Arena; the Graduation Show’s programme of live talks and debates. (Live Broadcast Camera by Erick Hille).

View the full-day archives [here](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/graduation-show/graduation-show-2021/programme) or if you want to view any of the Graduate Talks or Panel Discussion from The Arena, you can find them [here](https://designacademy.nl/p/research-and-debate/the-arena/2021). 

# THE ARENA
The Arena is a live talks, debate and performance platform that takes place at the centre of the annual DAE Graduation Show. It provides space for emerging designers to not only present their work but to also engage in conversations about the ins and outs of design.

# CRITICAL DIVERSITY CONFERENCE
This [two-day event](https://designacademy.nl/p/research-and-debate/professorships/critical-diversity-conference) will include keynote lectures and panel discussions following three themes — Breathing, Becoming and Belonging. The intention is to stimulate theories and practices that can transform cultures that create an unequal distribution of power and privilege in higher education and wider society.
