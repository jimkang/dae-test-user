# ADMISSIONS Q&A - BACHELORS

---

## BA APPLICATION DEADLINES

*→ What is the deadline for BA applications?*
Applications for the academic year 2022-2023 are open from 1 November 2021 until 28 February 2022.

*→ Are there any circumstances in which I can still apply after 28 February*
No. DAE has a strict policy on admissions deadlines and will not make any exceptions, but you can still apply next year.

---

## BA PORTFOLIO

*→ What should my portfolio include?*
Your portfolio represents you – your passions and interests, your qualities and skills, the way you see the world. It should consist of your most recent work. This might include – but is not limited to – drawings, idea sketches, photography, videos, model making or (printed) digital work. It can be work from school or course assignments, but it should also include work produced under your own initiative, in your leisure time.

The admissions panel is very interested in understanding how you work and think, so it is important to show more than just the result of your projects. This means you should include research, ideas, choices you have made and each step in your process.

You should also add (pictures of) the results of your two DAE home assignments to your portfolio before you submit it. If you feel that you don’t have enough 3D work to present, you can complete and add an extra DAE home assignment.
Once you applied for DAE, you can upload your portfolio, no later than March 1, 2022.

*→ What should my portfolio look like?*
The portfolio should be a simple A4 folder or document. It does not need to be designed – the focus should be on the content.

*→ What kind of work should I present / put in my portfolio?*
We are very much interested in your way of working and thinking, so please show all steps in your process (ideas, sketches, choices) don’t just show end-results. Show what represents you the best, models, 3D projects, drawings, pictures, movies, etc.

## 3D WORK

*→ What is meant by 3D work in the portfolio requirements?*
3D work means spatial work (in three dimensions), so it is not flat like a drawing or made in a 3D computer program. Think of projects and models made of cardboard, clay, wood, metal, textiles, plastics, ceramics or other materials.

## QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS BA

*→ What are the qualification requirements*
To be admitted you need a Dutch HAVO-, VWO- or MBO-4-diploma or international equivalent (senior general secondary education, pre-university education, or senior secondary vocational education). Our admissions page includes information on how to check if your international qualification meets [the requirements](https://designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/how-to-apply/bachelor-admissions). 

*→ Can I still apply if I don’t have a HAVO-, VWO-, MBO-4-diploma or equivalent qualification?*
This is possible if you are over 21, but you must pass a test to prove you are capable of working and thinking at the required level. For more information on this, see our [BA admissions page](https://designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/how-to-apply/bachelor-admissions).

*→ Do I need to provide the results of an English test like IELTS?*
Chinese students need to provide their IELTS score to fulfil the Visa/Nuffic requirements. Other students are not required to take this test to meet the requirements. This is not within DAE’s control.

We do test the English proficiency of all candidates during the interview process. Students at DAE are required to be proficient in English, both to facilitate communication with their tutors and to develop and write their research thesis. If you are not fluent in English, you should consider delaying your application until your English language skills reach the level required.

---

## FINANCE

*→ How much is the tuition fee?*
The statutory tuition fee is set by the Dutch government every year. The institutional tuition fee is set by the board of DAE and is based on the statutory rate. The tuition fee for 2021-2022 will be published in October 2020. Tuition fees are outlined in full [here](https://designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/student-life/tuition-fees).

*→ What other costs should I take into account?*
DAE asks students to set aside funding to cover living expenses, which are outlined in the right-hand column of the [tuition fees](https://designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/student-life/tuition-fees). International students might need to prove they can pay these expenses.

## GENERAL QUESTIONS 

*→ What is taught in the first year?*
In the first year, students are introduced to a wide range of techniques and develop basic skills. These include drawing, painting, form research, architecture, working with textiles, metalwork, woodwork, using digital software like Photoshop and Illustrator, and 3D modelling.

*→ How long does it take to graduate?*
The bachelor programme lasts for four-years. The first year is a basic year. After you have passed the first year, you are asked to choose one of the design departments for the remainder of your studies.

*→ Is it possible to skip the first year?*
All candidates must go through the same admissions procedure. All BA students start in the first year, known as the Propaedeutic Year, in September; transferring into a higher year is not possible. From experience, we know that students need to develop a strong foundation that reflects the DAE approach – with relevant skills, knowledge and experiences – to be able to feel at home and to grow within the DAE environment.

*→ Can I get exemptions for classes that I have already taken somewhere else?*
No, there are no exceptions or exemptions.

*→ Does the Academy provide housing or rooms for students?*
No, but we do have a list of agencies we can recommend for students to begin their search for housing. We advise you to start looking for a room as soon as you know you are accepted at DAE. More information can be found [here](https://designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/student-life/housing).

*→ Can I get a scholarship?*
No, not in Holland or from the Academy. Sometimes, international students can access scholarships in their own country for international programmes.

*→ I want to design fashion/furniture/cars, is DAE right for me?*
That depends. DAE has no specific graphics/fashion/car design departments. If you are sure you want to design in only one specific field, a specialised academy might be a better solution for you. DAE teaches design from a broad perspective. This means that students learn and are exposed to a lot of different areas of design and come into contact with other industries that are impacted or intersect with design.

*→ I have dyslexia, will I be given more time to complete written exams or tests?*
Yes, you will be given more time and a laptop from DAE. However, you must discuss your situation with the [student counsellor](https://designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/student-life/care) first.

## MA PORTFOLIO

*→ What should my portfolio look like?*
The portfolio should be one single document, with images and written examples of projects, research and processes. It should reflect your creative and critical position as a designer, as well as give the admissions committee some insight into your interests. It can be presented as a PDF or website and may also include sketches, unfinished and conceptual work. The quantity of work you should include is left to your own discretion. 

---

## QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS MA

*→ What are the qualification requirements*
The minimum requirement is a completed course at Bachelor level or higher. Preferably in design, design history, curatorial studies or an equivalent discipline.

Applicants with a BA in art, architecture, art history, or the humanities, with a demonstrable affinity with design, can also apply.

Only in extremely exceptional cases will DAE deviate from the rule that the MA is a two-year course and that a completed BA programme is a requirement for admission. Students who believe they are eligible for specific exemptions can submit their request to the General Masters Coordinator via <Masters@designacademy.nl>.

*→ Do I need to provide an English test like IELTS?* 
Chinese students need to provide their IELTS score to fulfil the Visa/Nuffic requirements. Other students are not required to take this test to meet the requirements. This is not within DAE’s control.

We do test the English proficiency of all candidates through the one-minute introduction videos in the initial application and the interview process. Students at DAE are required to be proficient in English, both to facilitate communication with their tutors and to develop and write their research thesis. If you are not fluent in English, you should consider delaying your application until your English language skills reach the level required.
