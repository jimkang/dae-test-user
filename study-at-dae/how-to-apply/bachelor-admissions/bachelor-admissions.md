# DAE BACHELORS' ADMISSIONS

---

## STUDY AT DESIGN ACADEMY EINDHOVEN
Applications for the 2022-2023 academic year open on 1 November 2021.

---

## HOW TO APPLY
There are three stages to any application for a BA at Design Academy Eindhoven.

1/ Fill in an application request in [Studielink](https://www.studielink.nl/). Studielink is the centralised enrolment platform for higher education in the Netherlands. After receiving approval on your application request, you will receive the information for your further enrolment by the end of the month.

2/ Complete the application form and upload the required documents (portfolio and home assignments). You will receive an email with the login details of Osiris Student which will give you access to the application form and the option to upload the required documents. The application form should be uploaded first, the portfolio and assignments can follow. All materials must be uploaded before 1 March 2022.

3/ Once all the application materials (form, portfolio and assignments) are uploaded, the application will be reviewed by the admissions panel and an invitation will be sent via email for a Skype interview.

---

## SELECTION DAYS

The interview process takes place over several days. For the 2022-2023 academic year, it will take place from 7 March to 18 March 2022.

If invited to an interview, applicants must ensure they have access to a laptop or computer with an internet connection and Skype installed on the date and time of the interview. It is strongly advised that applicants practice their interview beforehand, as they are limited to an 10- to 15-minute timeslot.

Each individual must also prepare a table display of their work, including the Home Assignments and AT LEAST five other 3D works or projects.

---

## DURING THE INTERVIEW

• An interview will take a maximum of 15 minutes. Applicants will meet one or two teachers.

• The discussion will begin with the Home Assignments. Explanations of these projects should be short and to the point.

• It is impossible to present everything, but applicants should make time to show some of their other works that tell their story and demonstrate their approach to making. The teachers will have the applicants portfolio to review as well.

• Every interview will include time for questions at the end.

---

## HOME ASSIGNMENTS

Every applicant must complete the Home Assignments as part of the admissions process. These two projects will form the core conversation of the Skype interview. The research and process for each project must be demonstrated alongside the final design. 

Find out more about this year’s Home Assignments [here](/p/study-at-dae/how-to-apply/bachelor-admissions/home-assignments).

---

## RESULTS

All results will be communicated to the applicants mid April 2022. There are three possible outcomes from an application: admission, placement on a waiting list (which stays open until the end of August 2022) or rejection.

Admission is valid only for the academic year stated on the application. In very exceptional situations (and after a written and well-reasoned request), the Academy can allow an admission to remain valid for another year.

Admission is offered on the condition that the applicant passes the necessary diploma/test and pays the tuition fees.

---

## VISA STUDENTS

There is an additional requirement for students who need a visa to study in The Netherlands. You must obtain a minimum of 30 ECTS (European Credits) for each year of study at the Academy. If you do no achieve this minimum, your visa will expire and re-registration will not be possible.

More information about studying in The Netherlands can be found via the Pathfinder application created by the Dutch Government.

## REQUIREMENTS: 
More information on Diploma's and other selection criteria 

QUALIFICATIONS
→ In order to be admitted you need to have a Dutch HAVO-, VWO- or MBO-4-diploma or international equivalent (senior general secondary education, pre-university education, or senior secondary vocational education)
→ If you do not have the appropriate diploma but are 21 or over, you can still apply. However, you must take and pass a HBO-test (the so-called 21+ test) to prove you are capable of working and thinking at the level that is required at a University of Applied Science (HBO). You must arrange this test yourself after being admitted to DAE
→ International students must check whether their diploma or qualification meets the Dutch standards. To check your qualification and find other information on requirements for studying in the Netherlands, visit the [Nuffic site](https://www.studyinholland.nl/plan-your-stay/admission-requirements). 


ENGLISH CLASSES
All education at Design Academy Eindhoven is delivered in English. This means a student’s English language skills must be strong enough to understand lectures and tutorials, communicate their ideas in verbal and written formats, and present and discuss their work. The standard required is comparable to an overall band score of 6.0 in the International English Testing System (IELTS).

All applicants will have their English skills tested practically and informally through the application process – in particular during the interviews. Candidates with insufficient English language skills will not be accepted.

Chinese students must also provide a Nuffic Certificate, including an IELTS language test score with a minimum of 6.0 points. More information of the Nuffic Certificate can be found [here](https://www.studyinholland.nl/plan-your-stay/nuffic-certificate-for-chinese-students).


OTHER SELECTION CRITERIA
Besides language skills, qualifications and/or tests, demonstration of the following attributes is key to a successful application:

• Creativity
• Vision
• Visual skills
• Reflective skills
• A research-driven approach to thinking/feeling/working

DAE is looking for candidates with an open mind, who approach problems in a playful way and with personal (social) engagement. These attributes should be clearly demonstrated in a candidate’s application, portfolio and interview.

## FAQ

DEADLINES:

→ What is the deadline for application?

Application for the academic year 2021-2022 is open from November 1, 2020 until February 28, 2021. The applications are now closed. 

→ The 15th of February has passed; can I still apply (being an international applicant)?
No, you can try again next year. DAE has a strict policy and will not make any exceptions.

PORTOLIO:

→ What should my portfolio look like?
Your portfolio is a means to represent yourself; your passions and interests, your qualities and skills, the way you see things, the world. Your portfolio consists of your most recent works; for example: drawings, idea sketches, photography, model making, (printed) digital work. It can be your work from school or course assignments, but also work done on your own initiative, in your leisure time. Try to show not only end results, but also your process; research, ideas, steps and choices. You should also add to your portfolio (pictures of) the results of your two DAE home assignments. If in general you feel you have too little 3D work to show, you can always make an extra DAE home assignment to add to your portfolio. The portfolio itself is a simple A4 folder which needs no designing since it is all about the content. 
Once you applied for DAE, you can upload your portfolio, no later than March 1, 2021.

→ What kind of work should I present / put in my portfolio?
We are very much interested in your way of working and thinking, so please show all steps in your process (ideas, sketches, choices) don’t just show end-results. Show what represents you the best, models, 3D projects, drawings, pictures, movies, etc. 

→ What do you mean with 3D work?
3D work means that work is spatial (in three dimensions), so it is not flat like a drawing, and it is not made in a 3D computer program either. Think of projects and models made of cardboard, clay, wood, metal, textiles, plastics, ceramics or any other material. 

DIPLOMA REQUIREMENTS
→ What are the diploma requirements?
In order to be admitted you need a Dutch HAVO-, VWO- or MBO-4-diploma or international equivalent (senior general secondary education, pre-university education, or senior secondary vocational education).Make sure to thoroughly check whether your diploma meets the above-mentioned required Dutch standard. For checking diplomas and other information on requirements for studying in the Netherlands: see the [Nuffic website](https://www.nuffic.nl/en/subjects/diploma/education-systems)

→ What if I don’t have HAVO-, VWO- or MBO-4-diploma, can I still apply?
If you do not have the appropriate diploma, but you are 21 or over, you must pass a HBO-test (the so-called 21+ test) to prove you are capable of working and thinking at the level that is required at a University of Applied Science (HBO). You can take the test after being admitted.

→ Do I need to provide an English test like IELTS?
Only Chinese student should provide their IETLS score due to VISA/Nuffic requirements. We do test all candidates’ English proficiency level during the interviews. Students at DAE are required to be proficient in English, both to facilitate communication with their tutors and to develop and write their thesis research. Applicants whose English is not fluent should consider delaying their application until their English language skills reach the level required.

FINANCE
→ How much is the tuition fee for Bachelor study?
Each year the statutory tuition fee is set by the Dutch government. The institutional tuition fee is set by the board of DAE and is based on the statutory rate. [See tuition fee for 2021-2022 here](https://designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/student-life/tuition-fees) 

→ What other costs do I have to take in account (rent, food, study materials, transportation, etc.)?  
Beside the tuition fees, a student must take into account the following [living expenses](https://designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/student-life/tuition-fees). These specifications are based on a single student living in Eindhoven.

GENERAL
→ Which courses are taught in the 1st year? 
In the 1st year you learn a lot of different techniques and basic skills like drawing, painting, form research, reflecting, architecture, working with textile, metal, wood, digital software like Photoshop, illustrator, 3D modelling. 

→ How long does it take to graduate?
The bachelor educational program is a 4-year program. The first year is a basic year. After you passed the first year, you choose one of the design departments. 

→ Is it possible to start in a higher year?
We have one and the same admission procedure for all candidates who apply for our Bachelor program. All BA students start in the propaedeutic year (from September); transferring into a higher year is not possible. From experience, we know that the specific approach that DAE has, needs a strong and adequate DAE fundament (skills, knowledge and experiences) for a student to grow towards the right understanding and feel at home too. 

→ Can I get exemptions for classes I already took somewhere else?
No, exemptions are not given.  

→ Does the academy provide rooms for (international) students?
No, but we do have a list of room agencies. We advise you start looking for a room as soon as you know you are accepted at DAE.

→ Can I get a scholarship? 
No, not in Holland or from the academy. Sometimes there are scholarships in your own country for international programmes.

→ I want to design fashion/furniture/cars, is DAE right for me?
That depends. DAE has no specific graphic / fashion / car design departments. If you are sure you want to design in only one specific field, you’d better go to a specialized academy. DAE teaches design in a broader perspective. That also means you learn a lot in different areas. 

→ I have dyslexia, do I get more time for theoretical tests?
Yes, when there is a theoretical test you get more time and a laptop from DAE. You have to discuss your situation with the student councilor first.
