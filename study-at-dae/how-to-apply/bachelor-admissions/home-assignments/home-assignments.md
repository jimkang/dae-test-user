# ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE HOME ASSIGNMENTS

We ask everyone who applies for the DAE Bachelor course to make two home assignments. It is one of the main topics of your selection interview; we like to talk about your way of thinking and working, your design process and how you approach the assignments. Not only do we want to see what the end result is, your process towards the end-product is equally interesting to us. Make sure that you can present your home assignments in your Skype meeting - and don't forget to include photos of your home assignments in your portfolio. Portfolio suggestion: if you think you don't have enough 3D work in your portfolio, you could always include a third home assignment.

The home assignment consists of two parts:

A. Mandatory assignment
B. Choose one of the five big home assignments

## A. Mandatory assignment for all candidates

A Seating object
Collect various materials in or around the place where you live. Choose three. One of the materials should be a hard material. Add a soft material and for the third material take something transparent. Use these materials to create a seating object for use in your home, garden or kitchen. If one of the materials does not work or does not fit, find a replacement, the maximum stays three. When choosing the materials and during the creation, think about construction / comfort / functionality / appearance. Record the process from the beginning: the choice of materials / sketches / images / prototyping and the final result. Challenge yourself, crawl out of your comfort zone and make sure the result surprises even you.

## B. Choose one of these five home assignments

1. An Offline Internet of Things
The so called internet of things connects (digitally enhanced) everyday objects, from cell phones to coffee makers or lamps to the internet as well as each other. This connection allows them to send and receive data (: information) to and from one another. Yet, the saying “Anything that can be connected, will be connected” might be true for things, but not necessarily for humans.

Even though there are fewer places on earth without internet, not all people have the means or technology to connect to it. Design an internet-free connection between at least three every day ‘things’ which allows two human beings to interact with one another offline.

Visualize/materialize this ‘Physical Internet of Things’ in any medium that you believe communicates your concept the most effectively. Anything goes: A drawing, a movie, a working prototype, an installation or even a live performance…

2. The sleep over
Build your own hut outside and sleep over. If you had a hellish night improve your design and try again. If you slept like a rose fine tune your design and do it again.

Bring sketches of your ideas, photos from the building phase, your sleep over experience, as well as an exact copy scale model of your hut, its interior and its materials.

3. Secret Box
Think of and make a 'Secret Box': a box that can (only) open in a secret way! There are a few conditions: - No electronics may be used - No separate/external key may be used (eg a magnet) - The solution / opening should not be too easy

Be original* and think about how you could use things like movement, gravity, air pressure, temperature or maybe even a liquid. *It is of course not the intention that you imitate something that already exists.

Also think about the appearance of your secret box: what kind of appearance suits your concept?

Be original, and try to be different!

4. The gesture
Find a person and/or animal in your surroundings who could benefit from some encouragement. Design a practical object or service which improves that person and/or animal’s life. Make sure your design process is visible in sketches, drawings and materials. Also bring photos of your design or service while being used.

5. The turn around
Find a spot in your surroundings which is a ‘dead spot’ a place where everybody walks by and nobody sees. Make an intervention that will give that spot something to look at.

Observe the place closely, visualize your sketches in whatever medium suits you, make a model of the situation and place your intervention in it to see how it could work, bring this model and pictures of the spot after it’s done.
