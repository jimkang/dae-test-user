# INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS

The Design Academy Eindhoven student body has an international orientation. Approximately 70 percent of Bachelor students and 95 percent of Master students are from outside The Netherlands.

The school is proud of the strong diversity of cultures and nationalities within its community and considers this a key part of its identity. This mix of backgrounds contributes both to the personal growth of individual students and to a global understanding of what design is and what it can do.

All of the classes at DAE are taught in English, and international students are expected to have a strong fluency in the language. Ability to communicate clearly in English is part of the admission requirements.

The school also has an exchange programme for Bachelor students, which is open to both Erasmus+ and on Erasmus+ candidates. Exchanges are not currently possible for Master students. You can find out more about our exchange programme and apply on the [dedicated page](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/student-life/exchange) on the DAE website.

Erasmus+ placements are available for both incoming and outgoing exchanges and internships within the EU. More information on the Erasmus+ programme can be found on the [dedicated page](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/student-life/erasmus) on the DAE website.

## BREXIT
 
Due to the UK’s exit from the EU, the status of students and applicants from England, Scotland and Wales has changed. 
 
Prospective students applying from the UK are now international, non-EU applicants and should read all of the information on this site about [permits, visas and fees for international students](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/student-life/residence-permitvisa-information). 

The latest information for British nationals studying in the Netherlands can be found on the Dutch government’s website [here](https://www.government.nl/topics/brexit/question-and-answer/how-will-brexit-affect-british-nationals-studying-in-the-netherlands). 
 
Current students with any concerns about their status or fees should contact the student counsellor, Olga Pullens: <olga.pullens@designacademy.nl>.
