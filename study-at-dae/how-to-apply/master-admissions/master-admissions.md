## The video
This is an opportunity to introduce yourself to the selection committee. Please mention the kind of designer you would like to be and why you want to attend DAE and follow a particular Master programme.

## The portfolio

## LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS

Applicants who are not native English speakers may be required to provide evidence of their English proficiency, although the application, video and interview process is usually enough to identify whether an applicant has sufficient fluency. 

Chinese students must also provide a Nuffic Certificate, including an IELTS language test score with a minimum of 7 points. More information of the Nuffic Certificate can be found [here](https://www.studyinholland.nl/plan-your-stay/nuffic-certificate-for-chinese-students)

## NEXT STEPS

Guidance will be provided by the committee if applicants are expected to present their work or discuss specific topics in their interview.

There are three possible outcomes: admission, being placed on the waiting list, or rejection. All applicants will be informed of a decision via email at the earliest opportunity. 

Once accepted, applicants will be sent a checklist to complete to formally confirm their status as an incoming student at DAE.
