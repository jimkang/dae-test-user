→[Application Form DAE Masters](https://admissionformdae.trajectplanner.nl/)

2. A copy of your valid passport

3. A digital portrait picture

4. A digital scan of your Bachelor Certificate
Practical note: please use a PDF format, and make sure you reduce the PDF file size before you upload the document.

5. Curriculum Vitae / Resume
Practical note: please use a PDF format, and make sure you reduce the PDF file size before you upload the document. Upload an updated version of your work resume.

6.  Motivation letter - please mention your Skype-ID at the right top corner
Practical note: please use a PDF format. Make sure you reduce the PDF file size before you upload the document in the transfer channel.
The motivation letter is a statement describing your motivation and expectations concerning the programme and your studies at Design Academy Eindhoven, including your professional expectations after completing your course. You should mention a few possible topics that you would like to research for your thesis proposal in the second year. The motivation letter is an extension of the application form.

7. One-minute introduction video
Practical detail: you can only upload a video in MP4 format using the following browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari.
Upload a one-minute video in which you introduce yourself to the selection committee. Make sure you mention what kind of designer you are and why you want to attend the DAE Masters course. You don’t have to be “on camera” yourself for the full minute, but we do want to see you, and hear you speak as well. We will evaluate this video based on the information that you communicate, the design representation and your level of English proficiency.

8. Digital Portfolio 
Practical detail: please use a PDF format with both pictures and text. Make sure you reduce the PDF file size before you upload the document. Please do not upload separate images; your portfolio should be a single document.
The purpose of the portfolio is to show a selection of your work, interests and fascinations. It should reflect who you are as a creative and critical person/designer, your position in the (design) world and your vision. Prepare a document that includes images of the concepts and products you have designed and any design-related or other research work or processes you have been part of (make sure to clearly mention your role within each project). You may also include sketches, unfinished or conceptual work. 

9. English proficiency test
We test all candidates’ English proficiency level, using the one-minute introduction videos, and at a later stage the interviews to test your fluency. Applicants who are not native speakers of English may be requested to provide evidence of their English proficiency level.

10. Nuffic Certificate for Chinese students
Due to student visa requirements, it is mandatory for Chinese students to present a Nuffic Certificate, which must include an IELTS language test score with a minimum of 7 points. Applicants whose command of English is insufficient should consider delaying their application until their English language skills reach the level required. Further information regarding the Nuffic Certificate can be found here.

## What To Do When You Are Accepted
Register through Studielink after May 1st 2020: www.designacademy.studielink.nl to confirm your intention to start the Masters programme in the 2020-2021 academic year and to arrange the payment of your tuition fee (more info here).

Students who are accepted must pay a € 500 pre-deposit on their tuition fee within 10 workdays after the acceptance date. They must also hand in or send in a certified copy of their BA Certificate. Enrolment in the course is guaranteed only AFTER the deposit has been paid and the student administration has received the certified copy of the BA Certificate.

In order to be able to study in the Netherlands, you may require a visa and/or residence permit. More detailed information. 

Non-EU students will receive detailed information and guidelines on visa preparation via e-mail.

Students who have been accepted, but need to defer a year for serious reasons (i.e. who will not be able to start their course in September 2020) must notify the Masters Office: send us an e-mail before 31 May 2020. The € 500 deposit will guarantee a place in the course for the 2021-2022 academic year, but not for any later year. A late cancellation (later than 31 May 2020) means you lose your € 500 deposit. In case you will not be able to attend the masters programs after the first deferral, you will lose the deposit as well.

The student administration must receive a copy of your Bachelor Certificate, issued by the educational institution that awarded your undergraduate degree (Bachelor level). If you are not sure about the validity of your diploma you can contact Nuffic to check if your title can be certified as a Bachelor degree. Students who are set to graduate in 2020 must bring a certificate, issued by the Board of Exams of their current educational institution, stating that they are enrolled for the Bachelor level exam and stating the exam date.

For Chinese students it is mandatory to present a Nuffic Certificate, including an IELTS language test score with a minimum of 7 points. Students at DAE are required to be proficient in English, both to facilitate communication with their tutors and to develop and write their thesis research. Applicants whose English is not fluent should consider delaying their application until their English language skills reach the level required. Further information regarding the Nuffic Certificate can be found here.
