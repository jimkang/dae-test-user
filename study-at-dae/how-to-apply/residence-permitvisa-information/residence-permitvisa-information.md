## FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS

You may need a visa and/or residence permit to study in The Netherlands, depending on your nationality and the duration of your stay.

You can find out whether you need to complete the immigration procedure by using our Pathfinder application. If Pathfinder recommends a Residence Permit for Study (VVR) or Residence Permit for Study (TEV), you need to undergo the immigration procedure.

With a Residence Permit for Study (VVR), you need a residence permit but not an entry visa. You can enter The Netherlands with just your passport. You will need to apply for residence in advance and receive it in The Netherlands.

In case of a Residence Permit for Study (TEV), you will need a long-term entry visa (MVV) to enter The Netherlands, as well as a residence permit. An MVV is an entry visa, which takes the form of a sticker that is placed in your passport at the Dutch Embassy/Consulate in your own country. With this sticker, you can travel to The Netherlands. It is valid for three months.

After you arrive in The Netherlands, DAE will inform you when your residence permit is ready. You can make an appointment with IND to collect your residence permit in Eindhoven. Once you have your residence permit, you will need to hand in a copy of this document to the Student Administration.

## APPLYING FOR A RESIDENCE PERMIT AND/OR VISA
After you are admitted to Design Academy Eindhoven, the student administration will help you apply for your visa and/or residence permit. As a student, you cannot apply for it yourself.

You can find more information about the immigration procedure on the website Study in Holland.

Although IND generally processes applications within a few weeks, we recommend that you start the process as soon as you can, as it may take some time to gather all of the required documentation.

DAE can only apply for your residence permit, when the required documents have been received and fees + living expenses* are transferred to the DAE bank account.

The documents are:
• copy of your valid passport (including all stamped pages)
• (Certified) copy of your (senior) secondary school diploma/ your BA certificate.
• Official translation of your diploma (when documents are not in Dutch, English or German)
• For Chinese students only: apply for a NESO certificate at Nuffic in the Netherlands. Nuffic will subsequently send this certificate to Design Academy Eindhoven on Your behalf.
• Intent to undergo TB text (if applicable)
• Antecedents Certificate (if applicable)
• Payment form

IND requires proof that you can financially support yourself during your stay in The Netherlands. Taking into account average housing costs and living expenses in The Netherlands, it sets a minimum amount (€897,56) a student will need every month of his/her stay (€897,56x12 = €10.770,72).

DAE only accepts the option of transferring the complete amount of living expenses to DAE as a valid form of proof. Once you have arrived in The Netherlands and you have opened a Dutch bank account, the living expenses will be transferred to your account.

## STUDY PROGRESS MONITORING (MoMi)

According to the Modern Migration Policy Act (MoMi), DAE is obliged to monitor the study progress of its international non-EU/EEA students.

Your residence permit is valid for the duration of your education. To keep this residence permit, you need to gain at least 50 percent of the nominal ECTS credits (30ECTS) for each academic year. If you do not reach this requirement, or your results during the year demonstrate that you will not be able to, DAE must report this to the Immigration Services (IND). You may lose your residence permit.

If your mentor, coordinator or study counsellor can see that you might encounter a threat of dismissal, we will let you know through a formal letter. We will invite you to discuss why you have not been able to gain sufficient credits.

If you already foresee difficulty in achieving enough credits in the coming period, you are advised to contact your mentor, coordinator or the student counsellor as soon as possible.

If you have not fulfilled the requirements of study progress and DAE decides that there is insufficient reason, this will be reported to IND. This means that DAE cannot act as your sponsor for your residence permit and you will no longer be allowed to study at DAE.

This information is only applicable to non-European students with a residence permit with the purpose of ‘Study’.
