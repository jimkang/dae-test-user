Design Academy Eindhoven believes that curiosity and openness, to ideas and to people, is a vital part of design. We are a design school, a place where individuals are educated in what they bring to the world and guided to find their own way. We take students concerns, talents and authentic responses to the world and show them how to make the most of themselves and uncover their purpose. To do so we need to provide new tools, new areas of expertise and a broader set of design and research skills. We as a school are a guide in the journey of identifying and developing each individual's motivation and strengths. We give each of them a platform to go out into the world and connect, creating design that has meaning and impact. 
  
## Master: Labs 
Eindhoven: Designers, curators and theorists work in a world in flux. They are faced with complex themes that cannot be reduced to readily solvable design problems. More and more they will be crossing the boundaries of their disciplines, while the themes they work on deserve the critical view of well-informed creative minds. The Master course at Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE) offers students the tools needed to research and analyse complex situations, and develop personal views on possible interventions, both to improve their individual design, or design theory, practice and to create (multidisciplinary) collaborations with others.

The minimum requirement for new Master students is a completed course at Bachelor level in design, design history, curatorial studies or equivalent discipline.* During the Master course the authorship of the designer or designtheorist will be reinforced. Students strengthen and focus their positions; learn to reflect on the profession and its limits; develop their personal imagery and signature; research topical questions in order to come up with valid design, presentation or text proposals. The cultural context in which designers and their products ‘function’ is the guiding principle, though the domains the students will research, may be socially, technically, or economically oriented as well.

Programmes

The Master programmes of Design Academy Eindhoven consist of four research departments: Contextual Design, Social Design, Information Design and The Critical Inquiry Lab. The two-year curricula are set up around research and design assignments, given by the design and workshop tutors, writing and thesis supervisors of the four departments, and lectures and workshops given by guest lecturers. During the second year, students work on individual research themes, which they have formulated themselves. In order to formulate topical research themes the Masters department cooperate with external institutions, governments, companies, leading experts, as well as with the researchers of the DAE- Lectoraten (Readerships/Professorships).

Apart from the lessons of each department, every department organize lectures by visiting critics and guests, theory, workshop and discussion events within the so called Source programme. Often these events are open for all master students. 

Students

The programme aims at professionals working within the domains of design, curatorial practices, design theory, critical studies, or related domains. Designers with an analytical writing talent gain more skills and knowledge, to be able to relate their design process to reflecting, curating and writing. Theorists with an academic background gain more insight into the practical, creative and hands-on aspects of the design process, to either deepen their analytical skills and/or to develop an expertise in designing curatorial plans.

Diploma

Completing the Master Course at DAE will lead to the title Master of Arts in Fine Art and Design.

Applicants with a Bachelor degree in art, architecture, art history, or the humanities, with a demonstrable affinity with design, can also apply. DAE will not deviate from the rule that the Master’s is a two-year course and that a completed Bachelor’s programme is a requirement for admission, except in highly exceptional cases. Students who believe they are eligible for certain exemptions may submit their request to the General Masters Coordinator via masters@designacademy.nl

GIVING SHAPE TO YOUR PASSION
Imagine receiving one of the following assignments:

“Design a new lay-out for the square in front of the Eindhoven train station”,
“Find a way of shaping the new luxuriousness”,
“Give someone the gift of time”

If this is the kind of challenge you dream of, and you are ready to work hard for it, then Design Academy Eindhoven is “the place to be”.

In your capacity as a designer you have a considerable impact on the way the world looks. After all, almost all the things surrounding us have been designed. Designers determine what it is we experience within and about a set of surroundings and how we might behave there. When you graduate you will be shaping people’s everyday lives. This may vary from jewellery, objects of everyday use, the interior of a home, to the way we organize care or how we feel in public space.

The world is a complex place.
As a designer you will have to deal with a range of social, economic and cultural interests.
Think, for instance, of the square in front of the train station in Eindhoven.
One person may see it as a social space, a place to meet; another as a site that should be easy to reach by car, and a third may want to give it a cultural and economic function above all else. As a designer you will operate amid all of these forces and interests. Time and again you will have to consider the pros and cons. Because each design process will see you stumbling upon dilemmas in the fields of sustainability, aesthetics, user-friendliness, production costs.

You will find yourself facing ethical questions. How much energy will transportation cost? How do you feel about manufacturing in low-wage countries? Is your design healthy? Assessments for which no manual can be written. The situation will be different every time, and opinions on what is right and advisable will change with time. So as a future designer the main thing is that you have an immense interest in everything that moves people. Or as one of our tutors put it recently: “a designer should know a little bit about a lot of things”.
