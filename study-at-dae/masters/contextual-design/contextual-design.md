# CONTEXTUAL DESIGN

## At Contextual Design we consider design as a way to make sense of the world, as a practice of cultural critique. Design is an intrinsic part of the cultural, social, ecological and technological reality. It creates new relations, transformations and ways of experiencing the world.

---

As designers and architects we are always designing within multiple contexts at the same time: within the wider contexts of society, within the context of systems of power and oppression, within contexts of modernity and colonialism, within the context of ecological destruction as well as spatial, social and historical contexts. Within the Contextual Design Master we believe that first there needs to be consciousness: a crucial understanding of context. The next step is deciphering and deconstructing the given contexts in the ongoing praxis of design. Then when we gain an understanding of our positions as designers and as individuals within the current contexts, we can start imagining how to design and reconstruct context, whether these are objects, spaces or relations.

---

At Contextual Design we don’t accept the field’s infinite urge to produce novelty for the sake of novelty and financial profit. If design has the capacity of shaping people’s lives, the practice of a critical designer should at all times revolve around the existential question ‘in which world do I want to live, and which role will my design play in this larger ideal? To answer this question we need to become more aware of our positions and power as designers, and recognise the layers of relationships between objects and space, power, identity, ecology and history.

---

Throughout the two-year course the Contextual Design Master aims to increase the students’ awareness of how each designed object, and each designed strategy, is a node in a network of relationships with other people, things and contexts. To underscore the personal responsibility of the designer we speak of authorship, which is not taken in its narrow interpretation of personal ‘stardom’ or ‘signature design’, both of which are embraced by the market as seduction strategies, but the truer conception of authorship as accepting ‘ownership’ and working from genuine commitment. Authorship implies the designer takes personal responsibility for all implicit meanings of a design, as well as the implications and consequences it carries. 

One of the main aims of the Contextual Design Master is to cultivate the power of the imagination and narrative. No matter how tight a space we are in, it is through the power of imagination that we can create a space, a context for ourselves, in which we can relate to ourselves and/or to others. We ask our current and prospective students to imagine that they are boundless, as if they are free, even when constrained. The artistic talents and experiences of students are the fertile starting points for observing, researching and arriving at this space of freedom from which to question the world with their own design ethos and personal commitment.

---

## Educational view

How to educate tomorrow’s design practitioners to be able to see, understand and navigate the many realities that we inhabit? Contextual Design underlines a focus on design as an interdisciplinary and hybrid practice in which personal curiosity, imagination and questioning, define the process, rather than a precisely defined area of cultural production, all encompassing solutions or a fixed set of skills. To design for this complex world, we need a better understanding of the many contexts and realities we inhabit as designers, not in a quantitative sense but in a qualitative sense. Design is one big research project into our human relations, human histories and the creation of narrative.

---

The programme rests on six pillars:

→Research
Tutors from a large variety of backgrounds offer both conventional and non-conventional tools to observe, analyse and reflect on specific contexts and research themes that range from abstract philosophical topics to real-life urgencies.

→Experimentation 
The students engage in hands-on experimental workshops with materials, movements, and technology which invite risk-taking and unexpected surprises.

→Imagination
The students are invited to let free their imagination, by which we hope to strengthen the students’ ability to reflect and increase their agency to dream beyond the known or given.

→Theory
In order to question dominant design paradigms the theoretical basis of the Contextual Design Master is based in ideas, methodologies, and values that center intersectional feminist, decolonial and ecological thinking. The understanding of our relationships to systems of power and oppression as designers are seen as crucial to articulate design that is created with positional awareness.

→Language 
Within the workshops and design studios, the creation of new design languages and the ability to understand visual language is taught. Consequently, the potential of design as a process to explore the layers of languages or even to create new design through new words are actively explored within the programme.

→Collaboration 
Contextual Design attracts practitioners from different cultural backgrounds, age groups and educational institutes; some have a BA in design or architecture, others are talented students with no official certificate, or students who have obtained an MA in art, philosophy, biology, neuroscience or another academic pre-study. All students work side by side in the design studios. Collaboration is encouraged in personal projects as well as in group projects as a way of learning.

## Programme structure

By taking inspiration from art, architecture, cultural and political theory, students get acquainted with a great variety of (often) opposing views on design and different ways of working. Students learn to disseminate their work through visuals and narrative to gain an understanding of the context they will create through their design projects. 

The two-year course is concluded with a personal design project, thesis and a semi-public presentation. 

In the first year, within the theory lessons, workshops and design studios, the students’ artistic making skills and research talents are enhanced. Gradually the students formulate their own questions, and proactively seek what they would like to further explore. 

The programme of the first year is, in essence, a space where the imagination can run free. It consists of workshops, design studios, visual language workshops, theory and writing classes, which all aim to deepen each student’s interests and artistic talents. The overall programme ensures each student follows lessons that are focused on research and lessons that mainly deal with the experimental making process. In the third trimester, all master departments collaborate in a multidisciplinary design studios on projects defined by an external commissioner. These ensure ‘real world’ questions and encourage collaboration. 

In the second year, the focus shifts to enhancing the students’ autonomy, as well as their reflective talents. It starts with the students choosing their own research themes. Design Research is key in the second year. By confronting their personal interests with a larger societal context, students interact with a growing body of knowledge, acquired for instance through literature study and filmmaking, and an on-going experimental design process, which is based foremost on artistic imagination. The (hands-on) design process and the theoretical part are parallel trajectories, which ideally influence each other in a fruitful way. At the same time both trajectories have their own dynamic and logic and might in the end lead to separate conclusions. 

Distinct outcomes are developed: 

→Design 
Depending on the researched theme and the specific talents of the student, the design can consist of an installation, objects, products, strategies, a proposal for an exhibition, a display of a research, or otherwise. 

→Visual language 
As all designs implicitly or explicitly contain larger narratives, the students are guided in translating their ideas into visual culture, i.e. film, photography or social/online media, with the possibility of this work becoming part of the final outcome of a research trajectory, or the research report. 

→Thesis 
At the end of the first year a personal theme is chosen, which is then researched through theory and writing and the process of design. The thesis is a report of the research and process. Apart from it being a report, the thesis is also an elaboration on the project’s context, aim and relevance. It should also offer insight into how the student intends to position themselves within this particular area of research. Usually the thesis is a text, but in exceptional cases the report can consist of film/video, graphic novel, or a well-organised and original display of experiments. In case a student wants to deviate from the convention of writing a text, they should discuss the options with the tutors. 

→Presentation / Performance / Master Proof 
The students learn how to best present their research and design process, for instance by way of a visual presentation, which offers information on the context, aim and relevance of the project for the (design) world.

## Lecture programme 

The lecture series of the Contextual Design Master aims to initiate critical debate on various aspects of culture, theory, practice and current topics. 

The 5TH FLOOR TALKS lecture program is organised in close collaboration with the Social Design department and coordinated by Delany Boutkan and Ceola Tunstall-Behrens. On a regular basis the students receive a newsletter, communicating which lectures will take place at DAE and which activities will take place elsewhere. 

The lectures in 2021-2022 will deal with a wide range of subjects, including: visual culture, music, feminism; material culture; design-neoliberalism-capitalism-(neo)colonialism; analysing and research, designers’ praxis; erasure; how to deal with fear; the integrated self; the artistic mind and semiotics. 

Apart from the lecturers of the collaborative programme, the tutors, guest tutors and students of Contextual Design incidentally organise CD LUNCH CHATS for CD students and tutors, which sometimes start with a lecture, followed by an informal chat.
