# MASTER'S PROGRAMMES AT DESIGN ACADEMY EINDHOVEN

Designers, curators and theorists work in a world in flux. They are faced with complex themes that cannot be reduced to readily solvable design problems. More and more often, they stray beyond the boundaries of their disciplines, and the themes they focus on merit the critical view of well-informed creative minds. 

The Master programmes at Design Academy Eindhoven offer students the tools they need to research and analyse complex situations. They support students in the development of their position in relation to design, improving their practical and/or theoretical practice and fostering collaboration across disciplines.

The minimum requirement for new Master students is a completed qualification at Bachelor level. This should preferably be in design, design history, curatorial studies or an equivalent discipline. Applicants with a Bachelor degree in art, architecture, art history or the humanities, and with a demonstrable affinity with design, can also apply. Exceptional students from other academic background will also be considered.

During a DAE Master course, the authorship of the designer or design theorist will be reinforced. Students strengthen and focus their positions, learn to reflect on the profession and its limits, develop their imagery and signature, and research topical questions to come up with designs, presentations or text proposals. The guiding principle for the Academy’s approach to education at this level is a focus on the cultural context in which designers and their products ‘function’, though the domains the students will research may be socially, technically or economically oriented as well.

## PROGRAMMES
The Master programmes at Design Academy Eindhoven consist of five research departments:

[Contextual Design](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/masters/contextual-design)
[Social Design](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/masters/social-design)
[Information Design](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/masters/information-design)
[The Critical Inquiry Lab](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/masters/critical-inquiry-lab)
[GEO—DESIGN](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/masters/geodesign)

The two-year curricula are arranged around research and design assignments, given by the design and workshop tutors, writing and thesis supervisors, and lectures and workshops given by guest lecturers. During the second year, students work on individual research themes, which they have formulated themselves. The Masters’ department collaborates closely with external institutions, governments, companies and leading experts, as well as with the researchers of the DAE Readerships to help identify and develop topical research subjects.

To complement its regular teaching programme, each department organises lectures by visiting critics and guests, theory, workshops and discussion events. These events are often open to all Master students.

## STUDENTS

The Master programmes are aimed at professionals working within the domains of design, curatorial practices, design theory, critical studies and related domains.

Designers with an analytical writing talent gain more skills and knowledge, helping them relate their design process to reflecting, curating and writing. Theorists with an academic background gain more insight into the practical, creative and hands-on aspects of the design process, to either deepen their analytical skills and/or to develop an expertise in designing curatorial plans.

## DIPLOMA

Completing a Master’s at DAE will lead to the title Master of Arts in Fine Art and Design.

DAE will not deviate from the rule that a Master is a two-year course and that a completed Bachelor’s programme is a requirement for admission, except in highly exceptional cases. Students who believe they are eligible for certain exemptions may submit their request to the General Masters’ Coordinator via <masters@designacademy.nl>.

The Master course at Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE) offers students the tools needed to research and analyse complex situations, and develop personal views on possible interventions, both to improve their individual design, or design theory, practice and to create (multidisciplinary) collaborations with others.

The minimum requirement for new Master students is a completed course at Bachelor level in design, design history, curatorial studies or equivalent discipline.* During the Master course the authorship of the designer or designtheorist will be reinforced. Students strengthen and focus their positions; learn to reflect on the profession and its limits; develop their personal imagery and signature; research topical questions in order to come up with valid design, presentation or text proposals. The cultural context in which designers and their products ‘function’ is the guiding principle, though the domains the students will research, may be socially, technically, or economically oriented as well.
