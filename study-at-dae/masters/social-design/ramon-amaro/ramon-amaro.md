Dr. Ramon Amaro is Lecturer in Art and Visual Culture of the Global South at UCL (University College London), Department of History of Art and Thesis Mentor at Design Academy Eindhoven, Social Design. Dr. Amaro’s writing, research and practice emerge at the intersections of Black Study, psychopathology, digital culture, and the critique of computation reason. Dr. Amaro is under contract from Sternberg/MIT Press to write a monograph on machine learning, race, and the philosophy of being, provisionally titled Machine Learning, Sociogeny and the Substance of Race. He is also co-founder of the Queer Computing Consortium (QCC), which investigates the “languages” of computation in its role in shaping locally embedded community practices.

Dr. Amaro has been on the Commissioning Board for the AHRC supported Ada Lovelace Institute JUST AI Network call for fellows in racial justice in AI, an advisor to the Barbican London major exhibition “AI: More Than Human”, Het Niuewe Instituut (Rotterdam) Research Fellowship, and Royal Academy of Art, The Hague (KABK),  Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE), and the Dutch Art Institute Roaming Academy. He has participated in the Russian Pavilion at the 2020 Venice Biennial of Architecture, the Dutch Pavilion at the 2019 Milan Triennale, Dubai Design Week, and the Dutch Pavilion at the 2018 Venice Biennial of Architecture. Dr. Amaro has also taught summer school programmes in Hong Kong at the Tai Kwun Summer Academy, in Mexico City at Materia Abierta, and remotely in Utrecht at “Posthuman Convergence” summer school, organised by Prof. Rosi Braidotti.
