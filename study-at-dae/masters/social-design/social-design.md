# SOCIAL DESIGN

## The Master in Social Design recognises the increasing importance of the social dimension in creating relevant design projects. In doing so, it proposes a comprehensive understanding of the discipline in relation to contemporary challenges.

## ‘Social Design’ is not taken as a given, but as a term that needs continuous redefinition: What do we understand by ‘social’? Who is included in that society? Does it only account for humans? What makes a design social?

This two-year MA is structured around workshops and mentoring sessions with design tutors, alongside presentations by critics and lecturers. At the end of the first year, students develop a research question that will inform their second-year thesis work and graduation project.

While we acknowledge the agency and the power of designers in intervening in today’s spaces and struggles, we also question the overconfidence in the discipline’s ability to ‘solve problems’. Design is often part of the problems that it claims it can solve.

*This programme is a place where we, staff and students, won’t be looking for solutions but for higher resolutions through which to rethink what society is and could be.* We will collectively question how we live and the values that we live by, and propose alternatives that could be deployed in design strategies and interventions. How can acts of design offer departures from established and normative modes of thinking and living?

We will discuss the ideologies and biases present in all acts of design and how these acts can also bring communities together; to include and exclude, to homogenise or diversify. What is the designer’s role in challenging, opposing, maintaining, legitimising or disrupting existing societal structures? Does design have a role in the struggles of depatriarchalisation, decolonisation, antiracism, and anti-imperialism? *How can designers help to shape collective imaginaries, material processes and aesthetics for non-exploitative, non-extractive worlds?*

To achieve this, the Master is designed as a space for intimate and provocative conversations; for fragility; for risk; for failing and succeeding unapologetically; for collective thinking; for exchanging ideas that are still in formation; for channelling the disruptive powers of imagination. Some of our tools and outcomes include protocols, participatory methods, digital applications, built structures, spatial strategies, material prototypes, legal propositions, speculative scenarios, smells, fictions, campaigns, performances, fungal and microbial-based technologies. The classroom becomes a site of continuous negotiation, enabling us to question conventional educational models by weaving structures of creativity and care. 

*Ultimately, The Master in Social Design is optimistic. It aims to instigate collective forms of knowledge and alternative forms of living.*

STUDENTS ARE OFFERED A FEW GUIDING PRINCIPLES AS THEY PROCEED THROUGH THE PROGRAMME: 

The Master in Social Design focuses on design’s social aspect but does not ignore the discipline’s other components. Students are designers who are prepared to reflect on and develop insights into their purpose and motivations, their role and responsibility towards society, and the desired and attained impact of their design practice. Students are viewed as professional designers during their studies and are encouraged to use the programme to develop a specific attitude and way of working.

Students are expected to develop their own definition of social design; the department promotes the creation of personal tools for a dynamic and ever-changing social design practice.

We believe in the need to think about new systems of value exchange between the different parties in our societies. These values can be tactile and tangible – it is by and through them that we have to build new bridges between societal agents.

The materialised object is still relevant as a tool, an agent or provocateur; as a trojan horse, as a solution, as a value and as a metaphor; to raise awareness of certain situations and develop strategies tactics to change systems and power structures. Students should be aware of this power and design their own tools for creating meaning and shared value as contributions to society.

Designed objects tell us about the place in the world in which they function and their manufacturing process. They carry the traces of the maker’s hand, the designer’s signature, and the technological possibilities of their time. They bear witness to their time, and their stories can be a great source of learning.

Awareness of hidden meanings is crucial for a designer. This awareness will help each designer create meaningful projects and relationships with their contexts. To stimulate each student’s awareness, the department will actively seek to turn all questions and all answers around. Through this process, the Social Design department will help students discover their talents and who they are. Students will learn to trust their intuition, mistrust their first assumptions, and improve their research proficiency, design potential and making skills.

Students will reflect on society, but their findings can only be meaningful if and when they are placed back into society and instigate debate in a larger, ever-changing context.
