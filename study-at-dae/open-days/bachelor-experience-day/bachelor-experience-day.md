# BACHELOR EXPERIENCE DAY AT DAE
How does it feel to study for one day at DAE?

The experience day is all about discovery â€“ feeling a match between your personal interests and talents and the Academy, the tutors, the methods used and the current students. The day is designed to get insight on how DAE works, what a day of a student would look like, and what it takes to be a designer. We are happy to organize these Experience Days onsite in Eindhoven on the following days:

I Wednesday October 27, 2021
II Wednesday November 24, 2021
III Wednesday January 26, 2022
IV Wednesday February 9, 2022
 
You can enrol for one of the experience days by filling out the [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=JP0cLFxinkix_I90WDDqZyWpNj8jKSBCgGAjjNANzThUMEY4TDVQU0dOU05SS0kzMkFBN1A4UkpPOS4u) from June 26th. You will receive more information about the Experience Day within a few days after you enrolled. You can only visit one of the Experience Days.

During these Experience Days, it is also possible to do a portfolio quick scan. If you would like to participate, please sign up for the portfolio quick scan. We will then plan a meeting in which you, together with other prospect students, will be assessed on your portfolio by a professional from DAE. Please note we do have a maximum amount of participants and once we reach the maximum, this option is no longer possible.
Sign up for the portfolio quick scans via the same form you use to sign up for the Experience day.
