# BACHELORS' OPEN DAY AND EXPERIENCE DAY AT DESIGN ACADEMY EINDHOVEN

---

## OPEN DAY
Design Academy Eindhoven hosts annual open days to give prospective students an introduction to the school and its courses. Anyone is welcome to attend. The objective of the open days is to help each individual understand whether this is the right space for them to continue their education and develop a critical and practical understanding of design. 

The next open day will take place on January 19, 2022 from 12:00-5:00 PM CEST. 

Due to Covid-19 we are not yet sure whether we can host our Open Day onsite (or online). We will keep the website up to date.

## EXPERIENCE DAY AT DAE
How does it feel to study for one day at DAE?

The experience day is all about discovery – feeling a match between your personal interests and talents and the Academy, the tutors, the methods used and the current students. The day is designed to get insight on how DAE works, what a day of a student would look like, and what it takes to be a designer. We are happy to organize these Experience Days onsite in Eindhoven on the following days:

I Wednesday October 27, 2021
II Wednesday November 24, 2021
III Wednesday January 26, 2022
IV Wednesday February 9, 2022
 
You can enrol for one of the experience days by filling out the [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=JP0cLFxinkix_I90WDDqZyWpNj8jKSBCgGAjjNANzThUMEY4TDVQU0dOU05SS0kzMkFBN1A4UkpPOS4u) from June 26th. You will receive more information about the Experience Day within a few days after you enrolled. You can only visit one of the Experience Days.

During these Experience Days, it is also possible to do an onsite portfolio quick scan. Sign yourself up for the portfolio quick scan and add your portfolio by email <bachelors@designacademy.nl> before the concerned day of Experience Day. If we have received your portfolio, we will plan a meeting, in which you, together with 3 other prospect students, will be assessed on your portfolio by a professional from DAE. 

Sign up for the portfolio quick scans in this [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=JP0cLFxinkix_I90WDDqZyWpNj8jKSBCgGAjjNANzThUODlaRzBWVVdSUFpUUERBTEo1MzNWSjVBRC4u).

## EXTENDED PORTFOLIO TRAINING
Next to our portfolio quick scan during the Experience Days and Open Days we also offer you the possibility to participate in an Extended Portfolio Training.

The first meeting with one of our admission teachers will take place online by MS Teams. Here you can show the status quo of your portfolio. You will receive feedback/tips/challenges to improve the portfolio. We will make another appointment on a later date when you feel ready for more feedback. Send us your new portfolio by mail and we will organize a MS Teams meeting for discussing your improvements. When you think your portfolio is strong enough for our admission days (in March) you can send it again and you will receive a written report with our last feedback.

The costs for this training will be 135 euro. The Experience Days are free of charge.

If you are interested in the Extended portfolio training, please fill in this [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=JP0cLFxinkix_I90WDDqZyWpNj8jKSBCgGAjjNANzThUOFlSWEQ2OVYzNjFBSDJKTjRWUkFYRTBBMi4u). 

After you have signed up for the Extended Portfolio Training, you will receive a Eventbrite link from us, so you can do the payment.
