# PORTFOLIO QUICK SCAN
During the Experience Days, Open Days & DAE Study Information Talks at our graduation show it is also possible to do a portfolio quick scan. If you would like to participate during an experience day, please sign up for the portfolio quick scan. We will then plan a meeting in which you, together with other prospect students, will be assessed on your portfolio by a professional from DAE. Please note we do have a maximum amount of participants and once we reach the maximum, this option is no longer possible.
Sign up for the portfolio quick scans via the same form you use to sign up for the Experience day.

If you would like to do a Portfolio Quick Scan during the Open Days or DAE Study Information Talks at our graduation show you do not need to sign up, but just bring your portfolio with you.

The portfolio Quick Scan is free of charge.

## EXTENDED PORTFOLIO TRAINING
Next to our portfolio quick scan we also offer you the possibility to participate in an Extended Portfolio Training.

The first meeting with one of our admission teachers will take place online by MS Teams. Here you can show the status quo of your portfolio. You will receive feedback/tips/challenges to improve the portfolio. We will make another appointment at a later date when you feel ready for more feedback. Send us your new portfolio by mail and we will organize a MS Teams meeting for discussing your improvements. When you think your portfolio is strong enough for our admission days (in March) you can send it again and you will receive a written report with our last feedback.
The costs for this training is 135 euro.

If you want to sign up for the Extended portfolio training, please fill in this [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=JP0cLFxinkix_I90WDDqZyWpNj8jKSBCgGAjjNANzThUOFlSWEQ2OVYzNjFBSDJKTjRWUkFYRTBBMi4u).
