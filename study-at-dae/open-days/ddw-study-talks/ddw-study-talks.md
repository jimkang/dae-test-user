# BA STUDY INFORMATION TALKS
18-22 Oct, 14.30 at Beursgebouw

Curious about the Bachelor programme at Design Academy Eindhoven? Join us during Dutch Design Week! 

Come and meet us during daily BA information sessions during DDW from Monday 18 October until Friday 22 October. The DAE study information talks will be held at het Beursgebouw, Lardinoisstraat 10. The sessions will take place from Monday to Friday at 14.30. Our doors are open to anyone who is interested in joining our Bachelor programme.  

During the information session you will get a first taste of our programme, from the Fundamentals to our Studios. This will be done in the form of a small presentation provided by a Bachelor student and a member of staff. Here you will be informed about the curriculum, the application procedure, and life at the academy. At the end of the programme there is room for Q&A’s. 

At 15.30 there is also a chance for a portfolio quickscan, this provides you with the possibility to show your Portfolio to one of our admission team members. They will give you feedback on the spot. If you are interested in this, bring your Portfolio (even if it is unfinished) with you. If you want to show you Portfolio digitally, make sure you bring your own device.  

And of course, you will be able to have a look at this year’s Graduation Show after this information session. 

The sessions are accessible via the "Fast Lane" entrance.

# PROGRAMME

# MA STUDY INFORMATION TALKS
18-22 Oct, 11.00 at the information desk in front of the Beursgebouw

Do you want to join the MA programme at Design Academy Eindhoven? From Monday 18 October until Friday 22 October 2021, Design Academy Eindhoven invites you to join our DAE Study Information Talks. Every day at 11:00 the doors are open to anyone who is interested in joining our Masters programme.  

The DAE masters invite you to join the informal tours and Q&A. Understand the methodologies of each department by listening to first-hand experiences from our current students and graduates. Starting with a tour you will be guided through graduation projects from students of every master department. The themes function as conversation starters to shine some light on the different approaches within the Masters. After the tour you will have a Q&A with current students, where you can ask everything you’d like to know about studying at the DAE Masters.

# PROGRAMME
Guided tours and Q&A by current MA students, presentations and Q&A by graduated MA students.

Tours on Monday & Wednesday
Masters of Excess:
Today’s society is one of mass consumption. These projects take what’s left from that excess and use it to their advantage.

Masters of Performance:
Look into projects that have a performative approach to their research, process or outcome.

Tours on Tuesday & Thursday
Masters of Contradiction:
Design, as life itself, is full of contradictions. How can designers make sense of a world that most of the time doesn’t?

Masters of Making:
Discover projects that stand out for their making.

Tour on Friday
Masters of Sound:
Explore projects that have sound – of any type – at their core.
