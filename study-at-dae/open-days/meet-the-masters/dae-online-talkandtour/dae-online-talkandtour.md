# WELCOME TO DAE'S ONLINE TALK & TOUR

DAE is opening its virtual doors to welcome prospective MA students to our first online Talk & Tour! 

Take a behind-the-scenes tour of the Academy building, find out more about what it's like to study here, meet current and former students, and explore all five of the MA courses with Q&As and talks from each department head.

This event is arranged across eight digital 'rooms', with seminars, presentations and meet-and-greets that you can explore at your own pace until 1pm CET. 

The schedule can be viewed under each room on the right, or in [this PDF download](https://designacademyeindhoven-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/nikita_hurkmans_designacademy_nl/Eb0-x2Fw7GVNllEJkU_C-J4Bpcsb6JJEeRCyCgNI83Sz5Q?e=QlNmJu
