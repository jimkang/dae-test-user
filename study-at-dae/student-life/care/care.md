# CARE AT DESIGN ACADEMY EINDHOVEN

SUPPORT AT DAE

DAE offers a range of support systems for different circumstances. These include:

→ Study counselling: after reporting a disability or study limitation to the student counsellor (possibly through a mentor), students can talk with their mentor about their study progress and personal well-being.  If a delay in studies might occur, mentors – in consultation with the student counsellor – can support a request for an alternative study plan, or a request to be temporarily exempted from the 80 percent attendance standard if appropriate. Please note that this is only possible when the necessity is clear and that all requests must be approved by the Board of Exams.

→ Personal counselling: if a student feels the need for (confidential) personal counselling, they can ask the student counsellor and/or their mentor for this support. Some students may need more support than others. For example, we usually advise students with an autism spectrum disorder to have more regular contact with their mentor and counsellor than students with mild dyslexia. The student counsellor can help students find external (professional) guidance and can also assist in administrative actions regarding study finance/support if applicable. 

→ Special facilities: students with indicated dyslexia or attention disorder, who have reported this in time to the student counsellor, are entitled to standard additional test time and, on request, the use of a laptop. We advise students with an autism spectrum disorder to make sure they have external professional guidance from the moment they start their studies at DAE. When needed, facilities like customised furniture or a quiet space to rest can be organised.

STUDYING WITH A DISABILITY OR STUDY LIMITATION

A disability (such as a physical disability, chronic illness, AD(H)D, dyslexia, etc.) or a study limitation (such as serious personal or family circumstances) does not need to be an obstacle to studying at DAE. With the right guidance, support and facilities, most students with disabilities or study limitations can complete their studies successfully.

DAE prefers to think in terms of opportunities. That is why we look for additional support and adjustments where needed and whenever possible, provided that the level of education is not affected and that the disability or study limitation is reported to the student counsellor (possibly through a student’s mentor) in advance. In case a disability or study limitation occurs during a student’s studies, the student counsellor must be notified as soon as possible. 

Many students who have graduated from DAE have presented interesting research and projects around subjects including sight impairment, dyslexia and mobility. These can be explored in [the archive of our Graduation Projects](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/graduation-show/graduation-projects).

WHAT IS A DISABILITY?

A disability can take various forms. From learning disabilities, chronic illnesses and psychological impairments, to movement, visual and hearing impairments. A disability is generally chronic. DAE follows the EU’s Equal Treatment Act. This means that all students will always be given a fair opportunity to properly complete their studies. The school will make the necessary adjustments to ensure this is possible.

---

WHAT IS A STUDY LIMITATION?

Study limitations can be diverse. These can include disabilities, but a wide variety of other circumstances can also limit students in their studies. In most cases, these are temporary. Examples might include a serious accident, sudden change in financial resources or family issues.

---

ACCESSIBILITY TO THE BUILDING

DAE is wheelchair accessible. However, we advise students to request a meeting in advance on this topic with the student counsellor as this needs to be considered in relation to the workshop spaces.

---

REPORTING PROMPTLY

It is of utmost importance that students inform the student counsellor and their mentor as soon as possible about a disability or study limitation so facilities can be organised on time, avoiding unnecessary delay.

If prospective students would like to consult the student counsellor or mentor before applying to study at DAE, they can be contacted using the detail below. Both the student counsellor and the mentors are also present at DAE’s Open Days.
