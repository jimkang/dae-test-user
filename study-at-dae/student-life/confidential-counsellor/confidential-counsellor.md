# CONFIDENTIAL COUNSELLOR
In an ideal world, a confidant counsellor would not be needed. However, the reality can be different. Design Academy Eindhoven has two external confidential counsellors for all employees and students. They are independent and are there for you to discuss sensitive matters or problems. Together with you, they can look at possible solutions.

DAE’s confidential counsellors are:

Tamara de Reu <dereu@devertrouwenspersoon.nl>
T +31 610 917 087

Jeroen Zweerts <zweerts@devertrouwenspersoon.nl>
T +31 626 698 484

Both are associated with “De Vertrouwenspersoon” (The Confidant), an organization that operates nationwide and works exclusively with professional and qualified employees.

## What is the role of a confidential counsellor? 
A confidential counsellor is there for discussing sensitive matters that affect your performance within the DAE. This could include undesirable behaviour like teasing, intimidation, discrimination and sexual intimidation by colleagues, employees or other students. You can contact the confidential counsellors directly. The conversations are always confidential and anonymous. This means that no one within the DAE organisation, where you work or study, will be informed unless you want this and indicate as such. 

There is not always an off-the-shelf solution for transgressive behaviour. This is why you consider suitable steps to be taken together with the confidential counsellor. These can be conversations with the objective of finding a solution for the problem you experienced, or perhaps it will appear appropriate that a complaint is submitted to the complaints committee. 

Through providing advice or pointers, the confidential counsellor shall look for options with you for resolving the problem or complaint. The confidential counsellor will support you throughout the process and if an investigation is initiated as a result of your complaint. It is important to know that the confidential counsellor will not take a single step without your permission. 

The confidential counsellor employs the Design Academy Eindhoven [Complaints procedure for undesirable behaviour](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/about-dae/dae/governance-and-regulations). This describes the confidential counsellor’s tasks and the complaints procedure for undesirable behaviour. Even relating or sharing a problem or situation can provide relief.
