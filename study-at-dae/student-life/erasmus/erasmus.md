# ERASMUS+

---

Design Academy Eindhoven participates in the Erasmus+ programme, offered by the European Union.

The Erasmus+ scholarship programme was created to promote student mobility in Europe. It provides grants for a wide range of actions and activities in the fields of education, training, youth and sport. Students can join a ‘partner’ institute in Europe, outside of their home country and country of study, for a maximum period of one year. The programme offers participants the opportunity to learn about other countries, languages and cultures and at the same time as pursuing their degree. Erasmus+ is also open to trainees, staff and volunteers, as a skills development initiative.



Applications for both incoming and outgoing exchanges will be reviewed carefully by DAE and only accepted if there is an appropriate level of quality in the content of the submission, a good match between student, institution and subject and available space.

ERASMUS+ ELIGIBILITY

Erasmus+ is open to:
• all DAE Bachelor students, who wish to study at one of DAE’s EU partner schools. A list of partner schools can be downloaded on the right.

• all DAE Bachelor students, who wish to undertake an internship within the EU (outside The Netherlands and inside Europe, not in your home country). This can be an internship during your studies or a traineeship after graduation.

• DAE tutors, who wish to participate in a teacher exchange with an EU partner school.

• DAE staff, as part of the staff professionalisation plan.

ERASMUS+ FOR BACHELOR STUDENTS

DAE collaborates with the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) on Erasmus+ exchanges.

If you are interested in an Erasmus+ exchange during your Bachelor studies, you can find out more about how to apply here.

DAE students must apply for an Erasmus+ grant before starting their internship, as there are several affairs that need to be arranged. Failure to apply before the internship may result in a cancelled grant. For questions about this requirement, contact <reconfirm@tue.nl>. For questions about the internships contact <internship@designacademy.nl>.

ERASMUS+ TRAINEESHIP AFTER GRADUATUON

A traineeship in Europe after graduation is possible through the Erasmus+ programme. More information can be found on the [TU/e website](https://www.tue.nl). 

It is essential to show an interest in this option during the last year of your studies, before graduation (for control the date on your diploma will be used). To do this, simply send an email to <reconfirm@tue.nl>. If your traineeship is confirmed you should email this address again, referring to your previous communication. The application process can only start after both of these emails have been received.

## ECHE
As part of the Erasmus+ Programme, DAE has obtained the Erasmus Charter for Higher Education (ECHE). The ECHE is an important award that the EACEA (Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency) gives to institutions after a careful selection and evaluation procedure of the activities carried out within the Lifelong Learning Programme framework during the previous seven years of activity. Thanks to the ECHE award, Design Academy Eindhoven will be able to participate in all the actions promoted within the new Erasmus+ programme which include mobility, cooperation and policies for change. This participation will provide funding for various study, training, teaching and international research opportunities. The ECHE has a 7-year validity, from 2014 until the end of 2020.
