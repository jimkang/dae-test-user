# DAE EXCHANGE PROGRAMMES
Due to the uncertainties for our campus and the complexities of travel brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have made the decision to suspend the exchange programs for the upcoming Spring 2021 semester. After further deliberation we made the difficult decision to suspend all exchange activities for next academic year. This means we won’t be sending and accepting exchange students for Fall 2021 and Spring 2022. We will continue our exchange activities in Fall 2022. This decision was made for the benefit of all students involved.

For both the Minor and Studio exchanges, you can select your top two preferences from the available departments. You can send your application form with the below items to <international@designacademy.nl>.

# TIPS 
FOR PORTFOLIO, MOTIVATION LETTER & INTRODUCTION MOVIE

The purpose of the portfolio is to show a selection of your work (not only end-results but also process), interests and fascinations. Sketches, unfinished or conceptual work can also be included. 
The portfolio – together with your motivation letter – should explain why you want to spend time at Design Academy Eindhoven in general and outline your interest in the specific Minor or Studio programme you have selected. 

Page 2 of your portfolio is your CV, page 3 of your portfolio is your motivation letter. The motivation letter is a statement describing your motivation and expectations concerning the programme of your exchange preferences at Design Academy Eindhoven. What would you like to learn? What is it that you are looking for?

Make sure your introduction movie is one minute long. This is your opportunity to introduce yourself to the selection committee. Make sure that you mention why you want to attend Design Academy Eindhoven. You don’t have to be ‘on camera’ for the entire minute, but we do want to see you and hear you speak as well. We will check your English level through the one-minute introduction video.
