# THE HOLLAND SCHOLARSHIP AT DESIGN ACADEMY EINDHOVEN
Design Academy Eindhoven participates in the Holland Scholarship, supported by The Netherlands’ Ministry of Education, Culture and Science and DAE. The Holland Scholarship provides a partial scholarship for the first year of your studies at Design Academy Eindhoven. The scholarship includes a stipend of € 5,000 and is awarded once for the first year of study. Please note that this scholarship covers living expenses and is not intended to cover tuition fees.

DAE offers five Holland Scholarships for incoming students at Master level. Currently, there are no Holland Scholarships available for incoming students at Bachelor level. 

The Holland Scholarship is exclusively available to new students who have not studied in a Dutch higher education institution before. Due to the limited number of available scholarships, Holland Scholarships will exclusively be awarded to new students starting their Master studies in 2021.

General application criteria:
→Your nationality is non-EEA (with the exception of Switzerland and Surinam).
→You do not have a degree from, or previously studied at, an education institution in the Netherlands.

For more information visit [www.studyinholland.nl](www.studyinholland.nl)

Online applications need to be submitted before 1 May 2021.

Please send your application to <international@designacademy.nl> including the following:
→Name
→Student number
→Master department applying or have been accepted to
→Motivation letter for scholarship (max. 250 words) 

Please use the motivation letter as an opportunity to describe your motivation for applying for the Holland Scholarship. The letter should explain how you intend to use the scholarship and detail the opportunities you expect it will enable during your studies at Design Academy Eindhoven. 

Outgoing Holland Scholarships for participants in specific partner projects will be made available to current, full-time registered DAE students who wish to study outside the EU/EEA. These outgoing Holland Scholarships will be announced later in the academic year. The scholarship is not intended to fund internships.
