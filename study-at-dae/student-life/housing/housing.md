# STUDENT HOUSING IN EINDHOVEN

---

It is and has always been the responsibility of each student to arrange their own housing while studying at Design Academy Eindhoven.

Eindhoven is a dynamic, young city with a large and growing population of students and young professionals. This means that it can be a challenge to find an affordable space to live. We advise all students to start looking for accommodation as soon as they have been accepted into a Bachelor or Master programme.

Although it can be tempting to rush into accepting a space when they are increasingly hard to find, it is important to read the contract and understand the cancellation conditions before making a financial commitment. If students don’t do this and their circumstances change, they could end up with a large accommodation bill for housing they will not need.

Due to the ongoing challenges around affordable housing provision in Eindhoven, DAE has created a dedicated email address to incoming and current students to share details of available spaces and register when they are looking for a place. 

More information about student housing in Eindhoven is available from the city of Eindhoven website. Further resources can be found on the [Study in Holland](https://www.studyinholland.nl/plan-your-stay/finding-a-place-to-live) website.
