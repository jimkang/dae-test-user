# PATHFINDER FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDY

## ABOUT PATHFINDER
Studying abroad can feel like a minefield of preparation, sifting through information about rights and requirements to understand what you might need to do to attend the institution of your choice. Depending on your nationality, the duration and purpose of your stay, the visas and permits you need may change. Pathfinder sorts this information for you based on your data.

Enter your details and use the filters to find the information that is relevant to you. The application can provide up-to-date advice on what you need for all of the phases of studying in The Netherlands: before arrival, upon arrival, during your studies and after you graduate.

## CODE OF CONDUCT
Design Academy Eindhoven acknowledges the Code of Conduct International Student in Dutch Higher Education. This [website](https://www.internationalstudy.nl) provides all of the necessary information on the Code of Conduct for (potential) international students.
