# RE-ENROLL NOW!

---

If you are studying at Design Academy Eindhoven, it is obligatory by Dutch law to re-enrol on time each academic year. You can arrange this re-enrolment via [Studielink](https://www.studielink.nl/) – this also includes the authorisation for the payment of your tuition fee. It is very important to do this as soon as possible as your re-enrolment must be completed before August 1. 

Please read all of the information below before contacting the Academy with any questions.

---

## THE RE-ENROLMENT PROCESS
→ EMAIL FROM STUDENT ADMINISTRATION
At the beginning of June, you will receive an email from the student administration informing you about the opening of the re-enrolment procedure. This email will be sent to the email address you registered in Studielink.  

→ RE-ENROLMENT VIA STUDIELINK
Use your DigiD to log in to Studielink if you have one. You are given a DigiD if you are registered at the City Hall and have a Burger Service Number. If you are not eligible for a DigiD because you are not an official resident of The Netherlands, you will be able to continue to use your Studielink username (email address) and password without a DigiD. 

→ PAYMENT AUTHORISATION
Arrange your tuition payment by filling in the digital payment authorisation in Studielink. Your fee will appear in Studielink automatically after it has been calculated by DAE. You can choose to pay by digital authorisation in one transaction or eight instalments. You can also pay via money transfer, using this payment form.   

→ CONFIRMATION OF RE-ENROLMENT
as soon as there are any changes, you will receive a notification through Studielink and/or the student administration, usually via email. Keep an eye on your Studielink page and your emails. You will also be informed if anything is missing from your account. 

→ NON-EU-STUDENTS 
One of the requirements for keeping your residence permit is to prove that you have sufficient means to support yourself for one year. You need to do this by filling in the statement for IND and sending it by e-mail to <studentadministration@designacademy.nl>.

## GRADUATION DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR

If you will be graduating during the academic year (for example if you are retaking your finals), you should re-enrol for the year and select the option to pay in instalments. When you graduate, you can unsubscribe in Studielink and DAE will calculate how much of the tuition fee you still need to pay or how much you will be refunded. You will receive an email with these details. 

For example, if you graduate on January 6 and unsubscribe from Studielink before January 31, you do not have to pay for the remaining months of the academic year. If you unsubscribe after January 31, you will have to pay one more month of tuition fee! 

If you are graduating in June, you will be automatically enrolled until August 31. You will not receive any tuition fee refund. 

Note: when you unsubscribe through Studielink, this will not automatically cancel any student grants or the student travel product on the OV-chipkaart. You must arrange this at the [Dienst Uitvoering Onderwijs (DUO)](https://duo.nl/particulier/student-finance/index.jsp).

## TERMINATING YOUR STUDIES
If you do not plan to re-enrol but want to remain enrolled until the end of the academic year (August 31), go to Studielink, select your current enrolment  and choose the ‘No, I do not want to re-enrol’ option. 

If you do not want to be re-enrolled, please let our student council know about your decision. 

If you decide to terminate your enrolment at DAE during the academic year, you must first make an appointment with the student councillor. After speaking to the student councillor, you can unsubscribe from DAE in Studielink.  You will be un-enrolled starting in the month following the month in which your request has been submitted via Studielink. You have a payment obligation for the months in which you are officially enrolled. 

Depending on the date you want to unsubscribe, you may be entitled to a refund of the tuition fee. If you paid the tuition fee in advance, you are entitled to a partial refund. If you paid in instalments by digital direct debit, we will terminate the direct debit payment as soon as your request to unsubscribe has been fully processed. This may take some time. 

The financial department of DAE will calculate how much tuition fee you still have to pay or receive back. You will receive an e-mail with these details. 
If you unsubscribe from DAE in July or August, you are not entitled to any refund of the tuition fee. 
When you are unsubscribed, you will no longer be entitled to use your DAE account, your DAE badge and DAE student card. Your account will be blocked.
