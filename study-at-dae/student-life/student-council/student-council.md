# STUDENT COUNCIL

---

The Student Council is the main path of communication between the student body and DAE's Executive Board. Its mission is to facilitate an open and honest conversation between all members of the DAE community and create a platform for students who want to have their voice heard. 

The Student Council aims to transform DAE into a learning environment that is safe for everyone. Currently, it is working together with multiple parties, such as the Anti-Racist Committee, as well as students from different departments to make that vision become a reality.

The Student Council can be contacted at <student.council@designacademy.nl>.
