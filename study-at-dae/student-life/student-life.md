# STUDENT LIFE
  
Design Academy Eindhoven is home to a community of over 700 students from more than 40 different countries. This diversity is a key element of DAE’s identity and a large factor in its status as one of the world’s most influential design schools.

The meeting of nationalities, cultures, backgrounds and abilities within the school enriches the work of the entire DAE community and helps student designers understand their projects within a global context. This is an institute where debate and difference are always welcome.

Many students make life-long friends during their time at the Academy and find that the network of fellow students they form while studying becomes an invaluable part of their professional life after graduation.

Students can access many benefits, including the ZBar, an in-house cafeteria that serves affordable and healthy meals during school hours with a constantly changing menu. The ZBar is often staffed by current students. Keep an eye on the jobs page for the latest vacancies.

A variety of systems and initiatives are in place to encourage a wide range of applicants and help current students if their circumstances change. The school offers counselling services to support current students through challenges that arise during their studies.

DAE also encourages exchanges, offering international students the chance to experience the school’s approach to design for one semester.

International students from outside the EU may need visa and residence permits to study in The Netherlands. You can check if you will need a visa or residence permit using our Pathfinder tool.

Admissions for the 2020-2021 academic year are now closed. The admissions process for the 2021-2022 academic year will open on November 1 at 9:00. Due to the current Coronavirus regulations, admissions will take place online.

Students at DAE are expected to provide their accommodation while studying in Eindhoven. When the Academy was founded, affordable housing was easy to find in Eindhoven. Today, the city has transformed and is becoming increasingly gentrified, making housing a significant issue for many students. We advise incoming students to begin their search early and spread their net widely. More information on this can be found here.
