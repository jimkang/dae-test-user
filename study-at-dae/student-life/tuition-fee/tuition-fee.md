## EXPLANATION 

Each year the statutory tuition fee is set by the Dutch government. The institutional tuition fee is set by the board of DAE and is based on the statutory rate. 

Students from the Netherlands, another country within the EU/EEA*, Switzerland or Suriname pay the statutory tuition fee. 
Students from a non-EU/EEA** country and students who have previously obtained a degree at a Dutch government-funded program, pay the institutional tuition fee.

** In some cases non-EU/EEA students are eligible for the statutory tuition fee. They have to meet the nationality requirement for a government study fund from DUO.
