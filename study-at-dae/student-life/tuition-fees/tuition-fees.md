# TUITION FEES AND LIVING EXPENSES

Tuition fees for studying at Design Academy Eindhoven are set annually. The statutory tuition fee is set by the Dutch government, while the institutional tuition fee is set by the DAE board, based on the statutory rate.

Students from The Netherlands, countries within the EU/EEA, Switzerland or Suriname, pay the statutory tuition fee.

Students from a non-EU/EEA country and students who have previously obtained a degree from a Dutch government-funded program, pay the institutional tuition fee. In some cases, non-EU/EEA students are eligible for the statutory tuition fee. They have to meet the nationality requirement for a government study fund from [DUO](https://duo.nl/particulier/student-finance/eligibility.jsp).

International students can use our Pathfinder tool to find out more about the tuition fees, visas and permits that are relevant to their status.

The figures below are the fees for one year of study.
