DAE sees design as a global phenomenon with an increasing urgency to reform social structures and systems. These include reforms in the fields of consumption, care, social organisation and future industries, but the list is inexhaustible.

Discourse forms an important building block for both our curricula and our research agenda. This is an institute where debate and difference are always welcome.

The Academy includes over 700 students from more than 40 different countries. This diversity is a key element of DAE’s identity. The meeting of nationalities and cultures within the school enriches the work of the entire DAE community and helps student designers understand their projects within a global context.

## THE COURSES
There are currently three levels of education at DAE. 

[The Foundation Year](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/foundation-year) is designed for prospective students who want to explore their relationship with design and prepare themselves to apply for to study on the Bachelor programme.

[The Bachelor programme](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/bachelors) offers students the opportunity to explore different approaches to design and design research, using concepts such as thinking through making. It encourages students to develop their own position as a designer and to develop a critical eye for the world around them.

[The Master programme](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/masters) offers students the tools needed to research and analyse complex situations and develop personal views on possible interventions, both to improve their design or design theory practice and to create (multidisciplinary) collaborations with others.

Our programmes are supported by [eight workshops](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/workshops) and a [library](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/research-and-debate/library) that allow students to experiment with materials and ideas at a practical level as well as exploring theoretical ideas and an understanding of their context in design history and in relation to other disciplines, such as science and medicine. The workshops specialise in 3D design, working with wood, metal, plastics, textiles, plaster, silkscreen printing, and digital printing and imagery.

## OPPORTUNITIES

DAE offers an environment that encourages students to work together and build connections, with open education floors and shared workspaces. Many graduates find that they have made life-long friends as well as a valuable network of designers and makers during their studies.

Graduates are invited to participate in the annual [DAE Graduation Show](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/graduation-show), which takes place during Dutch Design Week. The show is curated by a team selected by Joseph Grima, creative director of DAE. It is widely considered to be one of the most influential exhibitions of work by young designers, and a key moment in the international design calendar.

Students are also encouraged to engage with the school’s [Readerships programmes](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/research-and-debate/readerships), which often involve close collaboration with academic institutions, industry and government organisations.
