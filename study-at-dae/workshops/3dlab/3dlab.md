# 3DLAB

The 3DLab is an environment dedicated to the experimentation with and application of digital design techniques.

This workshop offers support for student designers who are interested in using 3D programs, automation and electronics in their projects. It also helps students transform their designs into practical and physical objects.

---

## The 3DLab currently has multiple facilities, including:

• 3D FDM printers (Prusa3D/Creality)
• 3D SLA/Resin printers (Form2/Form3)
• Laser cutter (Acrylic/Wood/Cardboard)
• Electric Lab Equipment (Soldering stations/Oscilloscope/Multimeters/etc.)
• VR Glasses (Oculus Rift / HTC ViVe)
• 3D Scanning

## "We are curious to see what idea or project brings you to the lab!"

 – the 3DLab team.

---

The experienced team that runs the lab can assist with a wide variety of skills, including 3D sculpting, programming for digital design, and the creation of circuitry for electronic projects.

Students are also welcome to drop by the space and talk to the team if they are available.

---

## OPENING HOURS

Currently occupying a space on level 3 1/2 within the Design Academy Eindhoven building, the lab has variable opening hours. 

The opening hours are regularly posted on the door of the lab space, but if students would like to access the facilities at a particular time, require specific assistance, or want to ask the team a question about a specific project, they can email <3DLab@designacademy.nl>.
