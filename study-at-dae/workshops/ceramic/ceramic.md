# CERAMIC

The Ceramic Workshop uses around 1000kg of plaster a month, making moulds for ceramic casting. But the space is not just for mould-making. In this workshop, students can experiment with creating forms out of plaster in all its incarnations, from liquid slip to solid clay.

Creating plaster moulds allows students to create multiples of the same object. Many of the moulds created are complex objects in themselves, similar to a 3D puzzle. The workshop team of Danielle, Nanda and Jie, guide students through the process of creating an original form and, if students want to, making a mould from it.

The team also assists students who want to make material tests and research and can provide historical contexts and knowledge of plaster and clay work. They can be consulted via Facebook for technical questions and advice on where to source related materials and equipment [click here](https://www.facebook.com/gipstantes/)

## “These processes can be highly technical, but are still grounded and deeply connected to the earth – literally.”

 – the Ceramic Workshop team.

Located on the first floor, the space is divided into a wet area for working with plaster, an area for working with clay and a glazing station for finishing ceramic objects. There is a separate room that houses three kilns – ovens for firing ceramics. The kilns can fire at temperatures up to 1300 degrees Celcius.

To use the workshop, students book in advance as there are limited workstations.
