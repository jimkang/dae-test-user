# SILKSCREEN

The Silkscreen Workshop provides students with the space and support to experiment with various printing techniques on a wide variety of materials.

It is possible to print on textiles, paper, plastic, wood, glass, rubber, leather and more. The Sample Wall provides a source of inspiration for students, demonstrating the variety of printing options that are possible.

The workshop houses a large variety of frames for printing, from A4 to A2 size. For larger pieces, the team collaborates with Make Eindhoven, situated in Eindhoven NRE area to help realise student designs.

The workshop only uses water-based inks. A variety of basic inks are ready to use on-site. The workshop also offers specialist inks, such as Thermochromic, Hydrochronic, Glow in the Dark, Interference and more.

It is also possible to use other techniques, such as Ausbrenner – a form of burn-out or Devore for creating patterns on textiles – and dying.

All students must be trained by one of the workshop’s three instructors before using the equipment available in the space. The Silkscreen team is Marianne Teurlings, Carri Harwig and Lara de Greef.

• Textile printing table with rubber surface (for a small test or to print large textile with design in repeat)
