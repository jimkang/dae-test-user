# TEXTILE

The Textile Workshop is a Walhalla for students with an interest in soft materials, colours and textile construction techniques.

Located on the third floor of the Academy building, this workshop focusses on experimental work with fibres, yarns, fabrics, plastics and leather. A wide range of yarns is available, including natural and synthetic fibres, as well as metal wire and more unusual materials. There are also bio-yarns for environmentally conscious work. Left-over pieces of material are collected for reuse to reduce waste.

Most equipment in the workshop requires training before use. Sessions can be booked on request by students or at the request of a tutor or department. They may also be organised and offered by workshop instructors when there is a clear need for group or individual instruction. Once trained, students can book time slots for solo work.

Crochet, embroidery, punching, spinning and twisting yarns, hand knitting, felt making and braiding are taught in small groups organised by the experienced workshop team.

Students must bring their student card to be able to purchase materials and use the workshop space. They should also bring a good pair of scissors, as these will be necessary for almost every textile technique and are not provided.
