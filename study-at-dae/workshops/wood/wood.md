# WOOD

The Wood Workshop is a hub for all wood-related making processes within the Academy, from sawing and sanding to bending and glueing.

Located on the first floor of the Academy building, the workshop provides a wide range of tools and machinery to students who want to develop their skills and realise their projects using wood. Raw materials, including a range of wooden boards, solid wood and veneer, are available to purchase form the workshop using a student card. Wood-glue and screws can also be bought on site. Materials must be paid for prior to use. MDF is not allowed in the workshop.

The Wood Workshop has a maximum capacity of eight students. Time slots can be reserved in-person by visiting the workshop. The main point of contact is Joop Aerts, who provides support and expert advice for students while they are working in the space.
