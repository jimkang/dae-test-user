# DAE WORKSHOPS

Learning through making is a core part of Design Academy Eindhoven’s approach to education, complementing a strong focus on research. By engaging with the making process within the school environment, students are able to experiment with shaping their own training and discover new ways to demonstrate their thinking, pushing the boundaries of existing processes and materials – occasionally discovering completely original techniques with ramifications for the wider design industry.

The Academy building hosts a [library](/p/research-and-debate/library) as well as eight practical workshops:


[THE 3DLAB](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/workshops/3dlab)
→ for electronics, automation and digital design and manufacturing


[DIGITAL WORKSHOP](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/workshops/digital)
→ for printing, access to computers and software, photography, videography and sound recording

[METAL WORKSHOP](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/workshops/metal)
→ for shaping aluminium, steel and other metals

[PLASTICS WORKSHOP](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/workshops/plastics)
→ for working with synthetic materials

[SILKSCREEN WORKSHOP](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/workshops/silkscreen)
→ for experimenting with hand printing techniques using a wide range of materials

[TEXTILE WORKSHOP](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/workshops/silkscreen)
→ for engaging with soft materials and textile techniques

[WOOD WORKSHOP](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/workshops/wood)
→ for machining and hand-working wood and wood composites (MDF is banned)

[CERAMIC WORKSHOP](https://www.designacademy.nl/p/study-at-dae/workshops/ceramic)
→ for working with clay and plaster

Together, these provide both the tools and knowledge to enable students to develop their ideas and take them off the screen and out of the drawing book into reality.

Although students are not offered specific, practical lessons in subjects like woodworking, metalwork or textile manipulation and creation, they are actively encouraged to be curious about materials and engage with the expert staff that run each workshop to help them discover and develop skills that are relevant to their work. The workshops are well-equipped with industrial-level machinery as well as tools for more traditional crafts.

The teams that support each workshop are also well-connected to makers and designers beyond the walls of the Academy, giving students access to ateliers, manufacturers and equipment that cannot be found within the average institution.
